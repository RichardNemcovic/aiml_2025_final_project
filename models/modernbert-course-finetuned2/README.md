    Learning objectives

    Have a clear understanding of, and be able to discuss, the

    theories and concepts covered in the course readings that are

    relevant to the analysis of global value chains in Africa. Apply these concepts
    and theories to critically analyse how

    global value chains are governed in Africa, how value is created,

    redistributed and appropriate along value chains, and what kinds of

    upgrading trajectories are available to GVC actors in African

    countries. Critically evaluate these theories, their application and their

    limitations in relation to explaining the effects of GVC governance

    and upgrading on economic outcomes and inequality that may affect

    various kinds of actors along the value chain – including the

    livelihoods of small-scale primary producers, and of women in

    The course develops economic and behavioral theories as

    a framework for analyzing corporate governance and value

    creation. For example shareholder value maximization can be

    implemented through contestable ownership, removal of takeover

    barriers, independent boards, stock option programs and legal

    protection of minority investors. Stakeholder value or

    social objectives can be implemented through other governance

    structures. Corporate governance in turn has implications for

    financial objectives, for example risk preferences or attention to

    stakeholders. The course will cover agency and other

    governance theories, alternative governance mechanisms,

    international corporate governance, corporate governance codes,

    ownership structure, boards ,executive compensation and compliance. The aim of
    this course is to gain an in-depth understanding of

    corporate governance and how corporate governance interacts with

    corporate finance to influence corporate performance. The course

    will introduce the students to corporate governance issues and

    teach them to analyse how different corporate governance mechanisms

    – like ownership and board structure, legal systems and incentives

    – contribute to the solution of agency problems and thereby

    influence corporate economic performance. The couse will explain

    how company boards exercise their key functions of stewardship,

    strategy, succession and supervision. Using this framework the

    course will then study the impact of corporate governance on

    corporate performance depending on company specific factors. The

    course will enable students to analyse corporate governance issues

    relevant to an individual company including an assessment of how

    ownership, board structure and national corporate governance

    systems influence company performance. Research-based teaching
