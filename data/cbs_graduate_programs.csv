https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/choosing-a-graduate-programme,Choosing a graduate programme,Choosing a graduate programme,Which is the right graduate programme for me? Have you asked yourself this question? Below you will find five tips to making the right choice.
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/choosing-a-graduate-programme,Choosing a graduate programme,1) Choose from what you know – not what you think you know,Each year students choose the wrong programme and some drop out because it does not live up to their expectations. The programme title never tells the whole story; instead get acquainted with the actual content of the programmes:
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/choosing-a-graduate-programme,Choosing a graduate programme,2) Be structured in your selection process – it give you time to make the right choice,Do you find it difficult to fully understand the consequences of your choice? Get a better overview by writing down your thoughts.
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/choosing-a-graduate-programme,Choosing a graduate programme,3) Don´t make a half choice – think of your complete profile,"When you choose a graduate programme, you are actually only choosing the courses you will have on the first year. The electives and the thesis is an equally large part of the programme. Here you can tailor the programme in the direction way you want."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/choosing-a-graduate-programme,Choosing a graduate programme,4) Plan B or C becomes a reality for many people – Choose your priorities wisely,"Your education is only a means to reach your goal, not the goal in itself. There can be a variety of ways to reach the same goal, or maybe you can set several possible goals. Consider working with multiple alternatives that can lead you in the direction you want to go."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/choosing-a-graduate-programme,Choosing a graduate programme,5) Choosing a graduate programme – choosing a career,"Your choice of graduate programme is the beginning of your choice of career. Therefore it is important that you choose something you can imagine spending time on for ”the rest of your life”. On the other hand, you should not think that your career path is locked in one direction, just because you have made certain choices. Your education is only part of your qualifications for future employment, and a professional life is long and can (luckily) go on to develop in many different directions."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/admission/entry-requirements,Entry requirements,Entry requirements,On these pages you can find general information about admission to CBS’ graduate programmes.
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/admission/entry-requirements,Entry requirements,Admission process - general principles (Part 1),"To qualify for a CBS master's programme, applicants must fulfil all of the following admission requirements: All CBS master's programmes have a limited number of places. If there are more qualified applicants than places available at a programme, there will be a selection process according to programme-specific selection criteria. In other words, fulfilment of the entry requirements does not guarantee admission. The selection process looks at the qualified applicants' overall bachelor background, favouring academic profiles that are closely aligned with the master's programme in question and documented knowledge within the disciplines specified in the selection criteria. Academic performance, reflected in your overall grades at bachelor level and grades within specific academic areas, is crucial. Some programmes also require a personal statement emphasizing relevant academic and professional experiences.You can find academic requirements, selection criteria, and language requirements for each programme by viewing their individual admissions pages. View all CBS master's programmes."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/admission/entry-requirements,Entry requirements,Admission process - general principles (Part 2),"Your educational background at bachelor level is subject to an overall, concrete assessment, in order to establish whether you complete the minimum required academic prerequisites to study the master programme you have applied for. We expect you to have qualifications that are equivalent to a CBS bachelor degree. Your bachelor degree must be issued by a nationally or regionally accredited, internationally recognised institution of higher education. Furthermore, in order to be considered relevant and qualifying for the master's programme you are applying for, your bachelor degree must include specific academic disciplines, defined for each master programme as a certain number of ECTS-points within specific areas of study.Your courses must have a specific academic content and level equivalent to bachelor courses at CBS. It is CBS Admissions who determine if a course can fulfil a certain academic requirement or not. We base our assessment on official course descriptions and study programme regulations published for your bachelor degree."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/admission/entry-requirements,Entry requirements,Admission process - general principles (Part 3),"Typically, the academic requirements are covered by academic and research-based courses at bachelor level (for example, courses taken at CBS, Aarhus University, University of Copenhagen and similar research-based PhD-granting institutions of higher education). If you completed vocational, practice-oriented courses (for example, courses as part of a Danish Professional bachelor’s degree programme), their academic level and content will not be equivalent to CBS bachelor courses, and they are therefore unlikely to cover the academic requirements of master programmes at CBS. The exact number of ECTS-points stated in the academic requirements must be covered. For example, 29 ECTS-points are not sufficient for covering a 30 ECTS-point requirement. If your grade transcript does not indicate the courses' workload in ECTS-points, CBS Admissions will carry out a conversion. Courses done at master level cannot be used.Relevant work experience cannot make up for any missing ECTS-points either."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/admission/entry-requirements,Entry requirements,Admission process - general principles (Part 4),"Keep in mind that, as well as entry requirements, each programme also has its own set of selection criteria, which are used if there are more qualified applicants than places available at the programme.The selection processIn the selection process, you are not measured against a specific set of minimum requirements; instead, you are competing for a place against all other applicants who are also qualified, according to the selection criteria defined for each master's programme.Selection is an overall assessment, focusing primarily on your academic achievements during the bachelor's degree (in terms of courses passed and grades obtained within certain disciplines). Your work experience may also be considered, if this is part of the programme's selection criteria.Since the selection process never focuses solely on your grades, there is no Grade Point Average (GPA) requirement as such. It is not possible and also irrelevant to know the GPAs of the admitted applicants.Read more about the factors considered in the selection process"
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/admission/entry-requirements,Entry requirements,Do you already have a master's degree?,"If you already have a two-year Master’s degree, whether Danish or international, you can only be accepted to a Master's programme if there are places available. As CBS has many more applicants than study spaces, we do not expect to have any available places."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/admission/entry-requirements,Entry requirements,Previously passed courses at master's level,"If you have passed any courses at master’s level, but you have not yet finished a master's degree, prior to starting a master's programme at CBS, you must indicate this in the application form. If you are accepted to a master's programme at CBS, any courses at master’s level you have passed before study start will be assessed and may be credit transferred into your programme. The assessment takes place after you have been offered and accepted a study place at CBS, and is made by the study board of the respective master's programme."

CBS uses the ECTS-point system to measure the total workload for the completion of a specific course or programme. Masters programme's entry requirements also use this measurement in the criteria we place on applicants. If your university uses a different point/credit system, CBS Admissions will evaluate on a case-by-case basis how to convert your credits to ECTS-points. To help you try and calculate yourself, to what extent you fulfil specific entry requirements, here is some information about the ECTS-system, how points are calculated and how conversion takes place.ECTS stands for European Credit Transfer System.The ECTS point system indicates the workload - measured in time - that it takes to complete a specific course. ECTS points do not measure the subject level or degree of difficulty, only the workload.Calculation of pointsThe ECTS system equates 60 ECTS points for one year of full-time study. According to the Danish Ministry of Education and Science, 60 ECTS-points are equivalent to 1,650 hours of work."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/admission/entry-requirements/my-credits-are-not-in-ects-points,My credits are not in ECTS-points,My credits are not in ECTS-points (Part 2),"One complete year of full-time study (or 60 ECTS-points) include the students’ efforts and time for course preparation, class attendance, writing assignments and taking exams, and it may also include internships. 1 ECTS-point in Denmark is equivalent to an average student workload of approximately 27-28 hours.Conversion to ECTS-pointsA full bachelor’s degree in Denmark equals 180 ECTS-points and consists of six semesters each of 30 ECTS-points. When converting credits, CATs, total hours or other types of points to the ECTS-system, you must first identify how many units of each type are necessary to complete a full programme of study. Furthermore, you must know the prescribed length of time for completion of a bachelor’s degree in your respective educational point system.We evaluate each individual applicant on a case-by-case basis when deciding how to convert national credits to ECTS-points."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/cems-mim/student-life,CEMS / Master's in International Management,Study environment (Part 1),"As a CEMS MIM student, you will experience at least 2 different study environments: one at CBS and one at the university where you study your term abroad.The study environment within CEMS is highly international. The people involved in CEMS represent a mix of different cultures given the many nationalities represented at the business schools in general and in the CEMS programme in particular, both among faculty members as well as students. As a CEMS student, you are closely connected to the CEMS environment at CBS and you are also part of the entire international CEMS community. This community consists of about 1300 new students every year across the various partner universities; over 20,000 alumni; corporate partners and dedicated and experienced CEMS faculty members. The programme gives you the opportunity to study and network with fellow CEMS students from other MSc programmes at CBS and with students from other universities around the world.

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/cems-mim/student-life,CEMS / Master's in International Management,Study environment (Part 2),"At CBS, the relatively small group of CEMS students (typically about 50 students each year) results in an intimate study environment in which there is a great social life among the students as well as personal contact between the faculty and the students.In general, CEMS students are open-minded, curious and very ambitious regarding their studies and future careers. To get accepted into CEMS, students put in an extra effort and they are highly motivated throughout the programme. In general, there is approximately the same amount of male and female students. The study environment is supportive, but some might also find it competitive."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/cems-mim/student-life,CEMS / Master's in International Management,What to consider? (Part 1),"Generally CEMS students are comfortable in a multicultural environment where academic challenges are part of their daily studies. They are ambitious and like the close contact to corporate partners and the possibilities for networking. The international and advanced nature of the programme challenges students to adapt quickly to new teaching and working styles, as well as to spend a semester abroad. An 8-week internship is required for the programme. It is your responsibility to find the internship. Therefore, it is a good idea to be proactive in the search for an internship. While it is your responsibility to find and select a relevant internship, the CEMS network and the CEMS programme elements expose you to our corporate partners and CEMS alumni at CBS as well as abroad in multiple ways. For example, the central CEMS organisation continuously publishes internships offered by corporate partners or the organisations where CEMS alumni work. Many CEMS students find their internships through these networks."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/cems-mim/student-life,CEMS / Master's in International Management,What to consider? (Part 2),"If you are considering applying to CEMS, you may wish to work on your language skills already as an undergraduate (depending on your language capabilities), since proficiency in two languages besides English is an assest when working or studying internationally.

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/cems-mim/student-life,CEMS / Master's in International Management,Teaching,"In general, teaching is developed and delivered in close collaboration with the corporate partners, which makes the programme practice-oriented, emphasising the link between theory and practice. Within CEMS, there is a large variety of course and seminar types. Skills seminars are oriented towards providing students with practical skills in small groups with approximately 20 students. Courses are built on lectures combined with case study discussions, role plays or simulations.Since most courses in CEMS are selected by the individual student from a list of CEMS courses, the teaching styles may vary. Teaching may also vary depending on where you study your semester abroad. Generally, CEMS classes are very interactive and engaging, and the courses encourage active participation.Given the close study environment at CEMS, the students often experience close interaction with professors and the programme administration."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/cems-mim/student-life,CEMS / Master's in International Management,Exams,"At CBS each course is concluded with an examination. Depending on the course you take, you will have examinations in October (first quarter courses), December/January and April (third quarter courses) and May/June respectively.Similar to the courses and teaching styles in CEMS, the exam types vary greatly depending on the choice of electives and the semester abroad."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/cems-mim/student-life,CEMS / Master's in International Management,Work/life/study balance,"The CEMS MIM programme is very demanding and ambitious. Many students take advantage of the many opportunities for extra-curricular work in the CEMS Club organising professional or social events, or they enrol in an extra skill seminar. Furthermore, many students are able to have a student job. The extra activities result in an increased workload as compared to a standard MSc degree."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/cems-mim/student-life,CEMS / Master's in International Management,Studying in English,"Before studying a programme taught in English you might want to consider the following: Practice makes perfectThere is a big difference between reading and understanding texts and expressing yourself in English both orally and in writing. This is a challenge for some students. Even if you are used to reading English texts on your bachelor programme, it is still a good idea to practice your English. Try to speak it on a regular basis, watch the news, movies and TV series in English. You should also read books and newspapers in English, as this will help you read faster and increase your vocabulary. A good command of English is essential for getting the maximum learning outcome of your programme."

By combining management accounting, performance management and corporate financial management theories, tools, and techniques you will be able to engage in strategic decision making, financial planning, analysis, and control in the finance function and beyond. You will be equipped to pursue a career in finance functions of firms or as management consultants in the CFO domain and beyond."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-economics-and-business-administration-accounting-strategy-and-control,"MSc in Economics and Business Administration - Accounting, Strategy and Control",About the programme (Part 1),"Accounting is the language of business, and this program has a strong focus on how to master this language to facilitate value creating decision making and behaviour inside organizations. Management accounting for planning and decision makingThe core of the programme is understanding and using financial and non-financial information to facilitate decision making, financial planning and analysis. You will learn how to measure anything from product cost, customer profitability, business performance and company value, to employee satisfaction, carbon footprint and other sustainability measures. You will learn about the strengths and weaknesses of these measurement tools, and how they can create a foundation for planning and decision making. The knowledge you gain from this will give you deep insight into the inner workings of the organisation and allow you to understand how value is created in the company, and at what cost. Performance managementMeasuring individual and organizational performance is the foundation for employees’ incentives to engage in value-creating behaviour."

Such issues include sudden increases in expenses, reduced product quality, deteriorating customer satisfaction, high employee turnover or continuous difficulties in reaching sustainability goals. To deal with these problems, you will learn how to design and implement incentive systems through which you can coordinate and motivate departments, teams, and individuals to manage their behaviour and overcome important challenges. Data analytics and communication skillsIt requires strong quantitative skills to understand and apply both theoretical models and empirical methods in management accounting and financial management. Finance professionals of today are, however, also required to actively engage in financial analyses for strategic decision making as partners to business functions across the value chain."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-economics-and-business-administration-accounting-strategy-and-control,"MSc in Economics and Business Administration - Accounting, Strategy and Control",About the programme (Part 3),"The programme helps you develop both the data analytics skills that are required to excel in increasingly digitized finance functions and the social skills required to create impactful engagements with the line of business across the organisation. This enables you to become financially informed business partners who ensure data-driven strategic and operational decision making in dynamic business environments. Also, it contributes to your understanding that a finance function is not merely a support function within organisations. Instead, it serves as a crucial advisor to top management and the rest of the organisation, providing fact-based data to aid their decision-making. This requires advanced communication skills and the ability to engage with various stakeholders. Customise your programme During the programme, you have various opportunities to create your own academic profile. ElectivesOn the 3rd semester, you can choose to study courses of your specific interest. CBS offers a large number of electives within a wide range of topics. You can also choose to take electives at other Danish universities. The electives you choose have to be relevant for your programme."

Therefore, the project report and work assignments during your internship have to be relevant to your study programme. CEMS - Master in International Management programmeOn, ASC you can apply for the CEMS - Master in International Management programme. CEMS MIM is a double degree programme, which gives you the opportunity to add a second degree in international management to your CBS degree.

In this programme there is, however, a very strong focus on understanding numbers in a broad managerial context. Quantitative skills are therefore very useful. But to be a good match for this programme you should also have a strong interest in understanding the logic behind the numbers and the ability to reflect on underlying assumptions to conduct the right analyses and deduct proper business insights on this basis Understanding numbers in a broader contextWorking with numbers is a big part of the programme, but it is more calculus than math, and there is also a strong focus on understanding these numbers in context. This could mean bringing in both psychological and sociological perspectives. To be able to work with numbers, and at the same time understand how people are motivated, and why they behave in certain ways, can be a challenge to some because of the big differences in the approaches to creating knowledge in these areas. But it will also be rewarding as the ability to combine these hard and soft areas is one of the important skills you acquire."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-economics-and-business-administration-accounting-strategy-and-control,"MSc in Economics and Business Administration - Accounting, Strategy and Control",About the programme (Part 7),"Mix of theory and practiceManagement accounting is an applied discipline. However, to critically reflect on the problems encountered in practice, you need a sincere interest in understanding, not just accounting and finance theory, but also psychological, behavioural, and sociological perspectives. You will work with developing your “hard skills” and “soft skills” simultaneously. This is to master the numbers, and at the same time understand how people are motivated, and why they behave in certain ways. Students who are committed to do this have good prospects of developing business partnering competencies that are in high demand in the CFO domain and in business in general.

The study environment at the programme is highly international with a significant proportion of foreign students. This creates an open-minded and cooperative atmosphere. And also, students are strongly encouraged to work in teams to improve their social skills and exploit the learning synergies that multi-cultural teamwork tends to bring. To strengthen the social bonds between students the ASC Social Committee organize various events during the programme such as dinners, excursions, and a Christmas Party. Interaction with the corporate partnersMany students combine their studies with student jobs. This further adds a practical perspective that fuels productive discussions in and outside the classroom. Another practical facet of your learning journey is achieved through your active interaction with the programme’s corporate partners."

In the first semester you are introduced to core concepts and methods within management accounting and financial analysis. The core concepts and methods form the foundation on which discussions in the second semester will take place.

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-economics-and-business-administration-finance-and-investments,MSc in Economics and Business Administration - Finance and Investments,MSc in Economics and Business Administration - Finance and Investments,"You will develop a deep understanding of the structure and workings of financial markets and financial institutions. Building on relevant quantitative and IT skills, you will learn to master state-of-the-art theoretical and empirical models for investment decisions and for the pricing and risk management of stocks, bonds, and derivative securities."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-economics-and-business-administration-finance-and-investments,MSc in Economics and Business Administration - Finance and Investments,About the programme (Part 1),"Financial instruments and investmentsYou will be trained in analysing stocks, bonds, and derivative securities using prevalent models for pricing and risk management. Investors form portfolios of different securities, and you will learn analytical tools for selecting portfolios optimally. The risk-return trade-off is essential to investments, and modern finance focuses on identifying relevant risk measures and the risk premia investors can obtain by exposing themselves to the various sources of risk. You will see theoretical models of the risk-return trade-off, but also empirical studies of the observed risk-return relation. Financial industry and marketsYou will obtain a solid knowledge of the different players in financial markets. Companies use financial markets for raising capital, for short-term liquidity and risk management, and as a source of information for internal decisions related to capital budgeting and corporate governance. Households interact with financial markets when saving and investing for retirement or other purposes and when taking mortgages and other loans."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-economics-and-business-administration-finance-and-investments,MSc in Economics and Business Administration - Finance and Investments,About the programme (Part 2),"Banks and other financial institutions act as intermediaries facilitating transactions and the efficient allocation of capital among corporations and households, but they also act in their own behalf as large profit-seeking and risk-taking market players and are therefore heavily regulated by society. You will learn about the financial decisions of companies, households, and financial institutions and the influence these decisions have on financial markets. Analytical and communicative skillsThe understanding and applications of both theoretical models and empirical methods in finance require specialized skills in mathematics, statistics, and IT. By nature, financial models build on tools and concepts from probability theory and statistics in order to represent the uncertainty which is so crucial for financial decisions. Computer-based quantitative software is wide-spread in the financial industry as it expedites the applications of the often quite complex models. The programme provides you with sufficient training of the necessary abilities both in a dedicated first-semester course and integrated in other courses whenever relevant."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-economics-and-business-administration-finance-and-investments,MSc in Economics and Business Administration - Finance and Investments,About the programme (Part 3),"Communicative skills are developed through shorter assignments and longer written reports, as well as both oral and written exams."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-economics-and-business-administration-finance-and-investments,MSc in Economics and Business Administration - Finance and Investments, (Part 1),"Customise your programme During the programme, you have various opportunities to create your own academic profile. ElectivesOn the 3rd semester, you can choose to study courses of your specific interest. CBS offers a large number of electives within a wide range of topics. You can also choose to take electives at other Danish universities. The electives you choose have to be relevant for your programme. See the current selection of CBS electives on Single courses and electives - Master MinorOn the 3rd semester, you can also choose to study a so-called minor. A minor is a package of electives within a specific academic area. Typically, it consists of 3 courses. By taking a minor, you strengthen your competences within a specific area of interest, and you can use it to qualify for specific jobs or industries. See the current selection of CBS minors on Minors ExchangeMany students choose to go on exchange on their 3rd semester; usually at one of CBS’ more than 300 partner universities. When you go on exchange through CBS, you do not have to pay for the teaching at the foreign university (with a few exceptions), and you can bring your SU (student grant)."

The academic internship consists of an internship period at a company, which is then completed with a project report. You can do the internship at a company in Denmark or abroad. When doing an internship you get the opportunity to relate theory to practice and reflect on the academic training you receive at CBS in a practical setting. Therefore, the project report and work assignments during your internship have to be relevant to your study programme. CEMS - Master in International Management programmeOn FIN, you can apply for the CEMS - Master in International Management programme. CEMS MIM is a double degree programme, which gives you the opportunity to add a second degree in international management to your CBS degree. This means that you will get both the MSc degree and the CEMS in International Management degree. CEMS is a 1-year programme, which you study in combination with your CBS degree in your 3rd and 4th semester. Part of it takes place at one of the other CEMS universities abroad."

You choose the topic you want to write about, which allows you to focus on a specific topic of your interest. Typically, you write your master's thesis with a fellow student. What to consider Finance is a quantitative disciplineCompared to most other areas in business and social sciences, finance is a quantitative discipline drawing upon economics, mathematics, statistics, and IT. This is necessarily so. Simply stated, the price of a financial security depends on its future cash flow, and this cash flow is typically unknown. Therefore, potential investors need to consider both the timing and the riskiness of the future cash flows. To quantify the risks, we need probabilities. We need economic arguments to choose the appropriate discount rates in order to determine the present value. To learn from historical data and test our models, we need statistics, and to work on large data sets we need IT. More generally, companies and households making financing and investment decisions have to determine and maximize the values of different choices."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-economics-and-business-administration-finance-and-investments,MSc in Economics and Business Administration - Finance and Investments, (Part 4),"Financial institutions and companies have to understand and price complex financial products and assess their riskiness. These key tasks require quantitative methods and the use of computer programs, such as Excel. Have a strong interest in finance and investmentsTo be a good match for this programme, you should have a strong interest in finance and investments, but also be prepared to use mathematics, statistics, and IT tools extensively. Your background in these fields should correspond to that of a BSc. degree in business administration from CBS and you should be willing to apply and strengthen those quantitative skills during the Finance and Investments programme. However, we emphasize that the focus is on analysing and modelling concrete financial problems and finding and understanding the solution. The focus is not on the abstract mathematics behind the solution method. The economic intuition supporting the derived results is developed, and real-life applications are illustrated and discussed throughout."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-economics-and-business-administration-finance-and-investments,MSc in Economics and Business Administration - Finance and Investments, (Part 5),"Furthermore, the programme provides a solid understanding of financial markets, financial institutions and their regulatory environment, households and non-financial companies, as well as financial accounting rules and practices. The programme is therefore distinctively different from specialized programmes in mathematical or quantitative finance/economics offered by other business schools and universities.

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-economics-and-business-administration-finance-and-strategic-management,MSc in Economics and Business Administration - Finance and Strategic Management,About the programme (Part 1),"Finance and financial instrumentsUnderstanding and using financial analysis and instruments is central in this programme. You will learn to interpret key figures for budgeting decisions, but also discus different ways for a company to finance itself and allocate its capital. From here you will develop a deeper understanding of how knowledge of finance can influence strategic decisions and company value. For instance, you will learn how best to design the pricing and payout policy for stocks, or how to apply insight from financial markets in the selection of investment portfolios. You will also be working with tools for calculating and managing financial risk. This will enable you to test and evaluate what potential risk, profit and impact a financial decision will create.Governance and organisationYou will also come to appreciate how insights into the economics of company organisation can be of great value. With this understanding, you will for instance be able to provide an analysis for decisions on how a company should organise itself, how and in what market it should compete, or whether it should make or buy a specific good or service."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-economics-and-business-administration-finance-and-strategic-management,MSc in Economics and Business Administration - Finance and Strategic Management,About the programme (Part 2),"In combination with this, you will learn how different structures of ownership or organisation will influence both the finances and the governance of a company. An example of this could be to create incentives and contracts that regulate behaviour and realign the differences in stakeholder interests, while keeping the cost of these transactions to a minimum.Corporate and managerial strategyThe strategic courses will teach you both theoretical and practical approaches to strategic management. This could for example be perspectives on leadership approaches or managerial processes that ensure optimal strategic actions. Through this you will discover that the complexity and paradoxes encountered in the process of strategy formulation, requires more than raw financial data. By learning to incorporate knowledge from all corners of the company, like the organisational learning potentials, logistical challenges or financial insights, you will be able to formulate optimal strategies for global sourcing. For instance, by exploiting the competitive advantage of the company and its suppliers, or by using the advantages of location in various countries to get ahead in the global competition."

The mix of theory and application requires that you should not only apply theory and perform the necessary calculations, but that you should also be able to understand, discuss and explain the relevance of these financial and strategic theories in various contexts. As such, the programme can be seen as consisting of roughly 40% theory comprehension and discussion, and 60% calculations and applications.

A multidisciplinary fieldSales management integrates business acumen, psychology, and strategic analysis.

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-economics-and-business-administration-sales-management,MSc in Economics and Business Administration - Sales Management, (Part 4),"This necessity arises from the dynamic nature of sales, where success is often measured by tangible results like revenue growth and market share expansion. To excel in this field, professionals must be adept at analysing sales data, understanding customer demographics, and predicting market trends.To strategically manage sales, one must consider various uncertain and sometimes conflicting factors such as customer needs, competitive landscape, and the effectiveness of different sales channels. Skills, tools and strategies Sales management requires a mix of analytical skills to interpret market data, and creative skills to design compelling sales strategies. We use statistical methods to analyse sales trends and customer feedback, and IT tools, like analytical and CRM software, to manage customer relationships and sales processes efficiently. Companies and sales teams need to develop and implement sales strategies that maximize revenue and customer satisfaction, even under very uncertain conditions. Sales managers must understand and leverage complex sales models and assess their effectiveness."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-economics-and-business-administration-sales-management,MSc in Economics and Business Administration - Sales Management, (Part 5),"These key tasks necessitate the use of sophisticated analytical methods and the ability to handle various sales management tools, including advanced software like Salesforce. A strong interest in analytics and peopleTo thrive in this programme, you should have a strong interest in sales and customer development, and be prepared to use both quantitative and qualitative methods extensively. Your background should ideally be equivalent to a BSc. degree in business administration, with a willingness to enhance your analytical and strategic sales skills. We focus on applying these skills to real-world sales challenges, developing strategies that work in practical scenarios rather than just in theory. Throughout the programme, we emphasise the development of strategic thinking and practical skills necessary for sales leadership. Real-life case studies and interactive discussions are integral to our approach. Furthermore, the programme provides a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics, customer behaviour, sales team management, and the ethical aspects of sales."

Instead, managers often face problematic situations consisting of many strongly interrelated issues across functional and organisational boundaries. Hence, an essential role for the general manager is to find ways of addressing such problematic situations by setting goals and engaging in value-creating problem-solving. You will acquire competencies for decision-making and problem-solving by developing your financial and analytical capabilities and applying these to real-life situations. You will learn to use data to engage in decision-driven analytics to develop value-creating solutions in dialogue with stakeholders. While the starting point is general management, you will develop your analytical capabilities and learn how to apply your knowledge in various areas.

Keep up to date with current affairsSince this programme deals with international politics and contemporary issues, we recommended that you keep up to date with current affairs. You can do so by following the media, in particular media with strong international coverage such as Financial Times or the Economist.From bachelor programme to MSc in International Business and PoliticsThe programme builds on the BSc in International Business and Politics.

These scientific theories are abstract, yet practical in the sense that they relate to organisations and their challenges. You will look at the organisations from many different perspectives and thus have a more holistic approach when working with theories in practice.The aim is to give you this holistic understanding of managing in organisations rather than provide you with tools. Tools of management are introduced in the programme, but as examples and not as directions for best practice. The aim is to provide you with understanding of how some tools perform in the big picture. As organisations have different challenges, environment, network, cultures etc. you always have to look at the issues from many perspectives to get the best understanding of the organisation you are investigating/examining.

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-information-systems,MSc in Business Administration and Information Systems,MSc in Business Administration and Information Systems,You gain an understanding of how the management of IT affects organisations and their financial performance – and how the organisational needs and economic reality creates possibilities and constraints on IT.
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-information-systems,MSc in Business Administration and Information Systems,About the programme (Part 1),"The programme combines topics of business and general management with technical topics addressing digital and information technologies of relevance for organisations. IT at the core of businessThe significance of digital and information technologies in business is greater than ever. Almost every activity and decision in a company depends on IT, and therefore IT considerations are key concerns in a range of business functions, including human resources, finance, manufacturing and security. Companies and organisations rely on IT when pursuing their digital business aspirations, communicating with employees, suppliers and customers, and IT is used to observe changes in markets, to keep up with supply and demand, and to reduce cost and risk by collecting and analysing data and information. In a world permeated by digital technologies, having an IT organisation that effectively contributes to organisations ambitions is not a choice, but is a necessity. IT as a toolIn this programme you learn how to use digital and information technologies to add value to companies and organisations. We care about digital technologies, because they change what is possible."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-information-systems,MSc in Business Administration and Information Systems,About the programme (Part 2),"Technology is viewed as something you can use and manage to reach the goals and solve the problems of a company. You will gain an understanding of the company and learn to analyse its needs providing the background for designing and implementing specific solutions. You will learn how IT affects the organisational structure and financial results of a company – and how the organisational needs and economic reality creates possibilities and constraints on the IT organisation. You will also learn how to box in the problems of a company – reducing the complexity and making it possible to analyse, create and implement IT solutions. And you will learn to think outside the box – and thereby not only find more effective ways of doing things but also create new solutions to old problems. Speaking two languagesThe dependence of companies and organisations upon digital and information technology creates a need for technical and non-technical-departments to understand and collaborate with each other – and a need for employees with an understanding of the implementation of technology into business. Employees with skills restricted to either business administration or computer science is no longer sufficient."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-information-systems,MSc in Business Administration and Information Systems,About the programme (Part 3),"Companies need people with qualifications that cross the boundaries of the two different areas.

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/accounting-strategy-and-control/elisabeth,Elisabeth,Elisabeth (Part 1),"Meet Elisebeth, a student from Accounting, Strategy and Control Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I chose ASC as I have always had a strong interest in business strategy and economics within companies, but also had a deep interest in the more managerial and leadership area and these do not always kind of match within the study programme. Looking for an economically oriented master’s including more strategic and managerial aspects, I got my eyes on ASC. ASC seemed like a good choice to cover my interests, and it has shown to be true. What do I like the best?I especially like how we both cover financial and calculative matters of companies and their economics, but also that we add the managerial level to get a full understanding of how everything works in practice. The constant strategic overview we keep of the company gives a very good understanding of different areas of the real world and lets us investigate the problems and how we can try to accommodate or plan ahead to avoid certain problems.How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? When starting my master's, I immediately felt that the academic level and difficulty increased."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/accounting-strategy-and-control/elisabeth,Elisabeth,Elisabeth (Part 2),"Even though I have had some of the topics before, it was clear that the master's level was more advanced and in-depth than the bachelor's. Of course, I have also quite quickly learned how I need to prepare differently here than on my bachelor's, so it's maybe more a matter of adaption to a new environment.What are the biggest challenges in my programme?It might be a small challenge, but we have quite many long lectures where it can be difficult to stay focused during the whole lecture. ASC has a quarter structure. Therefore, you have to kind of keep up in lectures as exams come quickly after. But this also means everything is fresher in memory and you don't really forget the things from lesson 1. Moreover, sometimes courses overlap a bit, which can be nice, but a bit confusing in some areas, as different courses then take up different themes but within the same kind of problem or term. What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?Perhaps I could have known this, but I would like to have been more aware of the increased academic level. I think I personally took on too much work in the beginning, meaning I could not follow up equally well on everything."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/accounting-strategy-and-control/elisabeth,Elisabeth,Elisabeth (Part 3),"Also, when starting, I did not think there would be many social activities on the Master’s, but that was put to shame. We have a good social committee that arranges different events or dinners quite often, and it really gets people together. Especially on a programme where people come from different countries. What do I want to do after finishing my programmeAs I find managerial economics very interesting, I want to pursue a career within that field - perhaps as a consultant within the field of management or within the economic field with a focus on the optimization of accounting procedures and practice. An interest that has grown within my current work, and I think about staying in that direction for some time. The consultancy world has always intrigued me, as you get to work with different clients and try to accommodate different challenges.If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Don't get overwhelmed or let everything overwhelm you in the beginning. Even though some things look unmanageable in the beginning, you will get there and you will learn it eventually, so no worries. And be open-minded and open to new topics of interest."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/accounting-strategy-and-control/elisabeth,Elisabeth,Elisabeth (Part 4),"Don’t lock yourself on one thing or something before starting. Also, attend the introductory week and social activities. That way you get to meet the people you are going to study with and meet people from different countries."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/accounting-strategy-and-control/simon,Simon,Simon (Part 1),"Meet Simon, a student from Accounting, Strategy and Control Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I was determined to pursue my Master's degree at CBS, as I found that they had the most interesting range of graduate programmes in Denmark. During my search, I came across ASC, which caught my attention as it gave me the opportunity to expand my knowledge in financial management alongside a greater focus on finance, which I hadn't had much of during my Bachelor's degree. One thing that was important to me when choosing ASC was that the programme offers a wide range of skills, which allows me to develop professionally.What do I like the best?From my point of view, the most valuable aspect of ASC's academic curriculum is its emphasis on applied learning. I rarely feel that what I'm being taught only applies to an academic career."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/accounting-strategy-and-control/simon,Simon,Simon (Part 2),"As for the social aspect, CBS has been exceptional in expanding my network and providing numerous opportunities to socialize with my peers in ASC and other study programmes thanks to a wide variety of social events available.How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?I observed a significant difference in the course material and exam expectations compared to my Bachelor's degree. I came to the realization that I needed to invest more time in comprehending certain topics, as some of them were unfamiliar to me. Despite the higher expectations and more challenging curriculum, I never left an exam feeling uneasy. Overall, I would describe the environment as more professional than what I'm accustomed to, but this has been a motivating factor for me, and I believe I've gained practical skills as a result.What are the biggest challenges in my programme?The biggest challenges in my study programme have been the finance courses, primarily due to my limited background in this area from my Bachelor's degree. Nevertheless, these courses ultimately became my favourite subjects and were the ones that I've learned the most from."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/accounting-strategy-and-control/simon,Simon,Simon (Part 3),"Admittedly, I had some times within my study where I felt like I would never get a comprehensive understanding of certain topics, but not once did this actually come true, and I never left an exam with a bad feeling. What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?If there is one thing I wish I had known before starting my studies at ASC, it would be that I would need to devote more effort to my studies than I was accustomed to during my Bachelor's degree. Additionally, I have come to recognise the significance of the social aspect of my studies, which has been very important in terms of motivating me to improve. Despite the topics being more intense at times, I haven't felt burnt out or discouraged, rather, I've been positively challenged. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?After my studies, I'd like to pursue a career within consulting, as I feel like this gives me an option to explore a lot of different areas within finance and ultimately helps me realise what I enjoy doing in my professional life. It also gives me plenty of experience for my future career."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/accounting-strategy-and-control/simon,Simon,Simon (Part 4),"ASC is very fitting for pursuing this career, as it teaches many useful skills that are specifically used within the area of consulting.If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Focus on socialising with your fellow study mates, and participate in all exercise classes, as these greatly improve your understanding of the different topics. I think it's important to enjoy your study life while also feeling like you can use it to progress within your professional career. I know that some people are not very motivated to increase their social circle on their master’s degree, but I also know that this is one of the things that many people come to regret towards the ends of their studies."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-advanced-economics-and-finance/florian,Florian,Florian (Part 1),"Meet Florian, a student from MSc in Advanced Economics and Finance Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I chose the Advanced Economics and Finance degree at CBS because I wanted to pursue a degree that combines economics with finance since my bachelor's degree was pure economics and my interest lies within capital markets and banking. CBS' high academic level and reputation and the beauty and life quality of Copenhagen itself made the choice even easier. On top, I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and challenge myself to study abroad. What do I like the best?What I like the most is the fact that our class is such a diverse group of people with different nationalities, study backgrounds and future goals. This diversity gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about different cultures and intercultural differences and build up a network. The most important learning for me was how to overcome these differences, grow all together and treat these differences as a valuable source for idea generation as well as considering circumstances from different perspectives. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?"
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-advanced-economics-and-finance/florian,Florian,Florian (Part 2),"For me, the two biggest differences are the pace and study input and the independent study style. The material taught is much more in-depth than on bachelor’s level, but it’s taught on the same time horizon, which results in a lot more study material. Secondly, the expectations of the student’s self-discipline are much higher than during the bachelor’s degree. You rely on yourself to organise and prioritise your studies. But after the first semester, I had already figured it out, and it felt normal to me. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?The biggest challenge, but with it also the greatest learning I had during my studies was to figure out how to handle my studies next to my professional work, voluntary engagement, sports and private life. Since the pace of a master's degree is way faster than that of an bachelor’s degree, it is important to be able to prioritise the tasks at hand and organise yourself. This challenge will also prepare you for the corporate world. What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?Before starting my master's I would have liked to have known that there is always somebody you can ask for help or advice."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-advanced-economics-and-finance/florian,Florian,Florian (Part 3),"Whether it is the student hub, your programme manager or the students from the earlier cohort, there will always be someone you can talk to. CBS itself offers many different sources to get the answer to your question. We were and are all in the same situation and therefore work together as a community. You just have to ask! What do I want to do after finishing my programme?After my graduation, I am looking for an interesting and challenging opportunity within the field of banking, asset and wealth management or finance. Since I started my studies at CBS, I also noticed the enormous focus on graduate programmes within companies. Step by step, I got to know more about the advantages of it and sorted out the different graduate opportunities with companies. Therefore, I am also applying for these entry positions with all their opportunities after the 1 to 2-year intro phase. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Enjoy life and the two years of your master's programme to the fullest. For the majority of students, it is the last chance to live, structure and shape your life the way you would like it to be, because you have few obligations and a lot of free time."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-advanced-economics-and-finance/florian,Florian,Florian (Part 4),"The freedom of self-determination, which is given to you during your studies, is a chance, and you are likely to not have that in the corporate world anymore. Cheers and enjoy your studies!"

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-advanced-economics-and-finance/mikala,Mikala,Mikala (Part 1),"Meet Mikala, a student at MSc in Advanced Economics and Finance Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?After finishing my Bachelor's degree in International Business and Politics at CBS, I wanted to continue onto a more quantitative and theoretical Master's degree that would help prepare me for a potential PhD programme in the future. This is when I discovered CBS' cand.oecon./Advanced Economics and Finance programme, which sounded like the perfect match for me as someone who is primarily interested in economics, but also wants to understand the relationship between the two highly interrelated disciplines of economics and finance. What do I like the best?My favourite course so far is Econometrics, taught by Prof. Ralf Wilke. In fact, Ralf's elective course in Økonometri, which I took on my Bachelor's, is what inspired me to apply for cand.oecon. in the first place. Econometrics is a course that not only challenged me academically, but has also given me the opportunity to achieve progressive learning in the sense that it has provided me with the foundation to build upon in the future. This, to me, is a crucial feature of learning, which I believe cand.oecon. provides."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-advanced-economics-and-finance/mikala,Mikala,Mikala (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? One of the main reasons I applied for the cand.oecon. programme was to be challenged academically and, compared to my Bachelor's, I would say that I definitely have been. For me personally, studying cand.oecon. has required long days in the library, constantly preparing for exams, and always feeling like I am a bit behind in every course. Even though this may not sound too appealing to most people, this is exactly what I had hoped for and what I wanted from my Master's. Also, I think that when you enjoy what you are studying, it is worth it. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?One of the biggest challenges in studying cand.oecon. is the constant pressure you are under – the next exams and assignments are always just around the corner. However, despite the heavy workload associated with the programme, the fact that all your peers are in the exact same situation and, in most cases, are as hardworking and determined as you are is a great source of motivation."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-advanced-economics-and-finance/mikala,Mikala,Mikala (Part 3),"This also means that although you most likely will spend a lot of time in the library, you will be surrounded by all of your classmates What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?I think it is worth emphasising that while the programme is academically challenging, it is not ALL about studying. This was one of my concerns before starting the Master's. Indeed, one of the things I love about cand.oecon. is that we still find the time to see each other (outside the library, that is). In addition, something that some tend to overlook before starting cand.oecon. is just how theoretical it is. Naturally, this is a plus if that is what you are interested in, but it is something you should be aware of. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?After finishing my Master's, I intend to do a PhD in the field of economics. As I have always enjoyed learning and delving into theory and methodology, the PhD seems like the natural progression for me. However, I am not entirely sure what I want to do after my PhD yet. A few possibilities I am considering include going into academia or working as a quantitative analyst in the financial/economic sector. In any case, I believe cand.oecon."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-advanced-economics-and-finance/mikala,Mikala,Mikala (Part 4),"opens a wide range of doors nationally as well as internationally. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…To not worry too much about the academic level of the programme. It is something that is often highlighted about cand.oecon., and that I have also put great emphasis on in my answers, but, given that you fulfil the formal requirements of the programme, I would not be too concerned. The programme is difficult but not impossible. For those who, like me, do not come from a maths-heavy educational background, I would highly recommend doing the prerequisite readings assigned before starting, as you will not have a lot of time to catch up later."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-applied-economics-and-finance/anders,Anders,Anders (Part 1),"Meet Anders, a student from Applied Economics and Finance Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I primarily chose AEF because of the subjects, which are all similar to my favourite courses on my bachelor programme. I wanted a more quantitative profile, but where the courses are still applicable to real world problems, and thus I felt AEF was the best choice for me. Furthermore, I had only received positive recommendations from friends and former students, which convinced me that AEF was the right programme for me. What do I like the best?What I like the best is the fact that all students have relatively the same interests in finance and economics, and thus pursue somewhat similar career paths. This makes the programme the perfect place to meet like-minded students and creates a great environment for networking and cooperative learning among your fellow students. Furthermore, I think all students are extremely helpful, and we all seek to help each other to become the best version of ourselves. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?I definitely feel that the academic level is higher than the academic level on my bachelor programme."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-applied-economics-and-finance/anders,Anders,Anders (Part 2),"I do, however, feel that all of us students are in the same boat, and it is not like certain students are much more ahead than others. As always, a course may seem difficult at the beginning of a semester, but when you go deeper into the syllabus and everything falls into place before the exam, it no more seems as unachievable as it may initially have. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?For me, the biggest challenges have been to balance my studies with my student job and a social life, because you need to make compromises somewhere. You should not believe that you can study everyday, work a lot of hours and join all social events on the same time. I still struggle sometimes to find the right balance between studying, working and going to social events, but I do believe that all three things are important elements of a student life.What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?I would have liked to have known that especially the 1st semester can be tough with many lectures and difficult subjects, but that you are not alone with that feeling. Many students find it difficult at first when starting on the AEF programme."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-applied-economics-and-finance/anders,Anders,Anders (Part 3),"I think it is very important to study together with friends and peers to discuss how you feel regarding the subjects, but also because you can learn a lot when discussing the different topics with your co-students. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?After finishing my programme, I look forward to a long summer holiday with hopefully a lot of traveling as I enjoy exploring the world. Afterwards, I plan to pursue a career within management consulting in order to support companies with a variety of problems they may face. Furthermore, I am certain that I will stay in contact with many of the friends I have met on AEF, and I look forward to follow them as well in their future careers.If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…I would clearly advice myself to participate in the introduction week of the programme as I was extremely fortunate to get a network of co-students with whom I can study, both during the semester and when preparing for exams, but we also see each other in our social lives. I have enjoyed many of the acquaintances that were initially formed during the introduction week and which have now become strong friendships."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-applied-economics-and-finance/claudia,Claudia,Claudia (Part 1),"Meet Claudia, a student at Applied Economics and Finance Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I chose to study AEF because my bachelor’s specialised in soft skills, whereas AEF offers deep, technical knowledge of economics and finance and I truly believe that both soft and hard competences create synergies that a successful manager needs to have. Moreover, I wanted to deepen my financial literacy and gain perspective of the economic world. I chose to stay at CBS because of its extensive networking opportunities, applied learning and the modern study environment. What do I like the best?What I like most about my programme is my classmates. They are humble, easy to talk to and very ambitious. At the same time, I find that most of our professors have very impressive backgrounds in both the academic and professional world. Personally, I think that AEF provides us with the space to learn new tools, such as Python, R, Bloomberg terminal and other digital tools, which can become very valuable assets in our portfolios. Finally, I enjoy the social aspect of AEF and the networking events.How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?"
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-applied-economics-and-finance/claudia,Claudia,Claudia (Part 2),"My bachelor’s degree mainly focused on how formal and informal aspects of internationalisation affect the global enterprise, along with Chinese language and culture. AEF, on the other hand, provides a more ‘objective’ snapshot of the world we live in. The key difference is in the advanced use of mathematics and the different approach to studying. Studying a master’s requires putting in more hours, but also more self-discipline. In my case, it also meant getting used to a much larger cohort and more competition.What are the biggest challenges in my programme?For me, the biggest challenge has been finding a healthy study-work-life balance to ensure that I can perform well at school and at work and still maintain my extra-curricular hobbies and passions. This has been particularly true for the first semester, where there are many classes and you are still getting familiar with the degree. Another challenge for me has been not skipping classes, as it is fairly easy to fall behind and lose track of what you’re studying."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-applied-economics-and-finance/claudia,Claudia,Claudia (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?I was not quite sure what to expect from AEF in terms of workload, but I wish someone had told me that it is important to study continuously and systematically. I would also want to know that it is normal to feel overwhelmed with exams and that is completely alright to take retakes. I took 4 retakes in my first semester and I turned out just fine. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?Currently, I work as an associate in a Danish investment bank. Yet, I do not know exactly what I will be doing after my studies. I see myself interested in M&A negotiations, consulting, data science and asset management. I still really enjoy learning about Asia, and perhaps I wish to work closely with the Asian financial markets, and eventually I might take a PhD in microeconomics and teach. This is just to say that AEF opens for very diverse careers. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…If I could give myself a piece of advice I would recommend creating study groups, because they help sharing and strengthening your knowledge and they keep you motivated."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-applied-economics-and-finance/claudia,Claudia,Claudia (Part 4),"I would also recommend to keep studying every week and do all exercises before the exam time comes. Moreover, I would recommend taking at least one very comprehensive statistics course during my bachelor’s to avoid feeling surprised in the first semester. Finally, I would also tell myself not to be afraid of asking questions."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/finance-and-investments/gwenael,Gwenael,Gwenael (Part 1),"Meet Gwenael, a student from Finance and Investments Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I chose the FIN programme at CBS mainly for three reasons. Firstly, I wanted to do my entire master’s abroad, as I didn’t have the opportunity to go on exchange during my bachelor’s because of the pandemic. Secondly, CBS has a very good reputation, not only in the Nordic countries, but also in Germany (where I am from). Thirdly, I realised during my bachelor studies that I have great interests in asset management and quantitative work, which I hope(d) to gain deeper understanding of through the FIN programme. What do I like the best?What I enjoy the best is the positive atmosphere among the students. I have found most of my classmates to be genuinely friendly and approachable. I appreciate the opportunity to interact with people from diverse backgrounds and learn from their perspectives. The programme can be challenging at times, but it's great to have classmates who are willing to help each other out. This sense of community has made my learning experience more enjoyable and rewarding. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?"
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/finance-and-investments/gwenael,Gwenael,Gwenael (Part 2),"I would say that the difficulty level is comparable, though the workload is higher. For example, in corporate finance we went through virtually the entire range of topics I had covered in all of the corporate finance courses I took in my bachelor's degree. If you haven’t previously studied at CBS or another Scandinavian university, the teaching methods can also be quite different: We work a lot with Excel, and exams are mostly open book and done on computers. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?I would say the biggest challenge is to stay up to speed with all the lectures and exercise classes, especially if you work alongside studies (which is very common in Denmark and particularly in the FIN programme, I would say). You usually cover 60-90 slides per lecture, the pace is fast, and you are required to understand the materials that were discussed in previous lectures, as topics build upon each other. If you at some point fall behind, it’s hard to close the gap. What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?I would say that the information on CBS's website provides a good overview about studying at CBS and the specific programmes."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/finance-and-investments/gwenael,Gwenael,Gwenael (Part 3),"What do I want to do after finishing my programme?I’m not yet sure. Before I moved to Copenhagen, I was really certain to directly jump into a fulltime position after my master’s. Since then, my perspective has changed, and I’m considering two paths: Either I will try to get into a graduate programme at one of the big asset managers/banks or I will further build up on my master’s and pursue a PhD. I hope that the remaining one and a half year of my studies will help me to find out what suits me the best. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…I would advise myself not to stress too much. The master’s at CBS is definitely a challenge, but if you did well in your bachelor’s and you get admitted for the master’s programme, there is a reason for that. So, as long as you put in the work, you will be fine and have a great time. Also, it takes time to settle in Copenhagen, finding an apartment, getting your CPR number and getting a bank account takes time, so I can only recommend to start informing yourself about the above early on."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/finance-and-investments/liam,Liam,Liam (Part 1),"Meet Liam, a student from Finance and Investments Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I chose to study at CBS for a variety of reasons, but the primary reason was the course content of the Finance and Investments programme. I thoroughly enjoy studying mathematics and all things quantitative relating to financial markets. In addition to the academic content of the programme, Copenhagen is a welcoming, prosperous and vibrant city to live in as a student. The city’s culture and diversity is a pleasure to experience, and the part-time student opportunities help strengthen your career prospects upon graduation. What do I like the best?The single aspect I like most about studying at CBS is the international student community. Although it may seem a daunting task arriving to live and study in Denmark on your own, many international students experience the very same feeling and are keen on networking and making friends upon arrival to CBS. My colleagues and friends come from a wide range of different countries, and it has been a pleasure getting to know like-minded and intelligent people while studying together."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/finance-and-investments/liam,Liam,Liam (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?Throughout the initial weeks of the first semester of the Finance and Investments programme, it quickly became very clear that this programme is significantly more challenging than the financial mathematics I covered in my bachelor’s degree. Much of what I studied in my bachelor’s was covered in far more detail, and the mathematical elements were more advanced and demanding. Of particular importance was my Excel capabilities and know-how. In my bachelor’s, knowing how to use basic excel formulas was sufficient, but my programme at CBS required more. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?The biggest challenge I encountered while studying at CBS was improving my time management skills. It’s very common as a student in Denmark to be employed in a part-time student position while studying your master’s degree. The combination of 20+ hours working and 50+ hours studying made time management skills a vital factor in my success in the Finance and Investments programme."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/finance-and-investments/liam,Liam,Liam (Part 3),"By managing your time wisely and effectively using all hours in the workweek, one can still find time to spend exploring the beautiful city with their friends. What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?I have been a prominent organising member of 3 student societies at CBS, however I only joined them part way through the first year of my studies. If I could go back and do it again, I would have joined these student societies on day one. Student societies present the opportunity to network with students from academic disciplines different from your own. Developing my network outside of my programme’s classroom has been an enriching experience, strengthening my social ties and network reach. I encourage all students to get involved! What do I want to do after finishing my programme?During my studies at CBS, I have worked part-time as a financial analyst at a leading start up in Copenhagen. Prior to starting at CBS, I worked full-time as a derivatives trader at a leading global proprietary trading firm in Canada. Following my graduation this spring, I will begin working as an oil trader at a firm in Copenhagen."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/finance-and-investments/liam,Liam,Liam (Part 4),"I thoroughly enjoy living in Copenhagen, and my network, CBS degree, and professional experience have allowed me to prolong my time in this city. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…A piece of advice I would give my past self before starting at CBS would be to say “Yes!” more often. Life is short and meant to be enjoyed to its fullest extent. Nobody says “I wish I would have spent more time working” when they are in the final years of their life. Go out to dinner with your colleagues, take a walk in the park with your friends on Sunday morning, say “yes” to the CBS networking events, take advantage of all these opportunities and experiences that will fall on your plate while you are a student at CBS!"

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/finance-and-strategic-management/josefine,Josefine,Josefine (Part 1),"Meet Josefine, a student from Finance and Strategic Management Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I decided to pursue a master’s at CBS after doing my bachelor’s at CBS, because this made me able to focus on the courses and learning, instead of focusing on administrative elements about how everything works, e.g., IT systems, exams etc. When choosing which programme I wanted to pursue, I made a clear list of the elements that I wanted to get out of my two last years of studying. The point that made FSM stand out from the other programmes was the academic profile with a mix of both strategy and finance. What do I like the best?As mentioned, I see the academic profile as a unique trait to FSM. I would also like to mention the social profile of the programme. There is a short introduction week when you start, and then we have the student organisation FSM Society that arranges social events, i.e. parties and dinners and corporate events, where we connect with Danish companies to learn more about the career opportunities. This is a great initiative since everyone gets to engage socially with other students on the programme and also network with a potential future employer."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/finance-and-strategic-management/josefine,Josefine,Josefine (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? I experience a higher academic level on the master’s than on my bachelor’s. A lot of the subjects progress on some of the basic subjects that I learned on my bachelor’s, but there is for sure a bigger curriculum and higher expectations at the exam. Especially for the financial courses, I would take more time to understand the exercises that are provided throughout the course and use my peers to study together. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?One of the biggest challenges I have experienced is the balance between my student job and classes. I learn a lot at both places, so it is always a trade-off between how I should spend my time. Another challenge is finding the right study buddies. I used my first semester, studying with a lot of different people from my programme, to find people whom I enjoyed studying with and where we all learned something and had similar academic ambitions. What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?At FSM, there is not a lot of group work before the very last project on the 2nd semester."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/finance-and-strategic-management/josefine,Josefine,Josefine (Part 3),"This means that you actively have to find your own study buddies, and I would recommend you to find at least one person to discuss the courses with. I would have appreciated a deeper understanding of the level of the financial courses. Coming from a bachelor with a stronger focus on management and strategy, I would definitely allocate more time to the financial courses. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?Overall, I really want to work with finance, strategy and sustainability, which I think this programme enables me to do through the mandatory courses and the electives on the 3rd semester. I think FSM is a great steppingstone for a lot of different careers due to the mix of finance and strategy. I hope to start out my career in management consulting to get to know different industries and gain a professional toolbox, and then from there decide on a more specific direction later in life. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Make time in the beginning to make new friends from your programme and get to know the academic requirements."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/finance-and-strategic-management/josefine,Josefine,Josefine (Part 4),"It will always be an advantage to have some friends you can study for the exam with, share notes with, do the business project together with etc. - it just makes it a little more fun. As mentioned, the academic level will increase when you go from bachelor’s to master’s, so take some time to familiarise yourself with the courses and their requirements."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/finance-and-strategic-management/timo,Timo,Timo (Part 1),"Meet Timo, a student from Finance and Strategic Management Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I decided to choose the master’s in Finance and Strategic Management because it is a unique, equally weighted mix of both financial and strategic courses. Aside from the specific study programme, CBS was on top of my list anyways. Not only Copenhagen with its outstanding living standard but also the mix of international and Scandinavian students, the university’s reputation within and outside of Denmark and the corporate partners convinced me. What do I like the best?It’s the people! Our teachers are all highly motivated and some of them even leading international academics in their field with major publications. Our CBS staff is very helpful with whatever issue occurs and available either via phone, email or in-person. And, finally, our fellow students have proven themselves being the top of the notch, which has definitely benefited my motivation, my critical thinking and challenging and the development of my problem solving skills. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?"
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/finance-and-strategic-management/timo,Timo,Timo (Part 2),"Through my bachelor programme in finance and accounting in Germany, I believe that I was very well prepared from an analytical perspective. The finance courses certainly need some pre-knowledge, but throughout the first weeks of the 1st semester, the teachers try to bring everybody to the same level. For the strategy courses, I undeniably felt a difference. The readings shifted from Harvard Business Review in the bachelor’s to more theoretical, SMJ or Journal of Management articles in master’s. Yet, the additional effort was manageable. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?Reflecting back, I see two major challenges I encountered. The first year required a lot from me as an international student: get used to the Danish culture (and weather), understand the teachers’ expectations, but also find a fair work-study-life balance. The other challenge regards the second year. There is nearly an infinite amount of options. It took me a while, but I finally decided to go on exchange instead of choosing a minor at CBS or joining the CEMS double degree programme. What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?That there is much more to campus than just Graduate House."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/finance-and-strategic-management/timo,Timo,Timo (Part 3),"Because all courses during the first year were held at Graduate House, my fellow (international) students and me spent little time in the other buildings. Honestly, now while writing my master’s thesis, I figured out: Dalgas Have isn’t even that bad! Kilen is great for a quick group meeting. And Solbjerg Plads has some cool spots for learning and hanging out as well. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?After completing my bachelor’s in finance where I took any available finance course out there, my current plan is a huge plot-twist: I want to do strategy! Currently, I am working in internal strategy at a quite young company but could likewise imagine switching perspectives and join one of the big consulting houses for external strategy work. It was the master’s programme and my professional experience that have shown me: crunching numbers is fun. But bringing numbers into a business context to shape the future is where my passion lays. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…CBS is more than a place for studying and writing exams."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/finance-and-strategic-management/timo,Timo,Timo (Part 4),"There are so many social and professional events organised throughout the year, sometimes with and sometimes without corporate partners. In addition, there are student clubs for nearly every hobby you could ever imagine. I would suggest myself to push myself a little further outside my comfort zone. Why not starting a new sport? Or joining an expert presentation about psychology or biotech?"

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/sales-management/tomasz,Tomasz,Tomasz (Part 1),"Meet Tomasz, a student from Sales Management Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?When researching different universities and programmes, I was drawn to CBS because of its reputation for academic excellence and its strong emphasis on practical learning. As someone who values hands-on experience and real-world application, I knew that CBS was the right fit for me. Many of my fellow students, including myself, are working for companies in different industries while studying Sales Management, achieving synergy between academia and corporate experience. It is only possible due to the Scandinavian corporate culture and CBS' recognition. What do I like the best?I like that the programme is very practical, and I often use knowledge from the courses during my everyday tasks as Global Business Development Manager. I think it’s great that you can use the knowledge from the programme in real-life situation. Another thing is that the Sales Management programmee is constantly on the positive list, which is a list of professions that experience a shortage of qualified professionals. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?"
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/sales-management/tomasz,Tomasz,Tomasz (Part 2),"Master’s programmes at CBS are more advanced and specialised than bachelor's programmes. As master’s students, we are expected to have a deeper understanding of the subject matter, and assignments are often more challenging and require more independent thinking with research. We are required to understand existing research and theory and sometimes develop new ones. However, by pursuing my bachelor’s degree at CBS, it gave me a strong foundation and by pursuing master’s I could further enrich my knowledge and specialise more in the particular field. What are the biggest challenges in my programme? Some common challenges that students face in any study programme may include: Group work: Sales Management requires you to work on group assignments or projects, which can be challenging if you have to work with people you don't know well or who have different work styles. However group exams prepare you for corporate life as, teamwork is a very important ability necessary to succeed. Time management: Balancing the workload of different courses and assignments can be challenging, especially when deadlines start piling up."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/sales-management/tomasz,Tomasz,Tomasz (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?Before starting my programme at Copenhagen Business School, I wish I had known more about the workload and group exams. The programme is intense and demands a lot of time and effort from the students and during a group exam, discipline and time management. It would have been helpful to get to know fellow students and establish connections and study groups earlier. This would help establish good study habits to keep up with the workload. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?I have already been working in my field of study while pursuing my programme therefore it has already been decided that I will continue my career path with my current company in Copenhagen and work on getting promoted to senior positions upon graduation. My long-term dream is to become a successful entrepreneur. Leading my own business to an initial public offering (IPO) has always been a dream of mine, and I am eager to use my experience and expertise to establish a company that will make a positive impact on society in the life science industry."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/sales-management/tomasz,Tomasz,Tomasz (Part 4),"If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…It would be to stay open-minded and be willing to step outside your comfort zone. University is a time to explore new things and challenge yourself, so take advantage of the opportunities that come your way. Don't be afraid to try new subjects, and definitely check opportunities for extracurricular activities and student organisations. CBS offers a wide range of activities and clubs that students can participate in, and I think it would have been beneficial to get involved in some of these activities earlier in my programme."

This program stood out as it's uniquely centered on innovation and entrepreneurship, offering a deep dive into sales strategies while embracing the power of cutting-edge advancements. It was the perfect blend of my interests in sales, technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship, making it the ideal choice for my educational journey. What do I like the best?I love how hands-on the learning is; we have lots of workshops with experts that share about their job in practice. Moreover, the community is amazing! It feels like a family with everyone being open and happy to help. Plus, this degree opens up a lot of career paths. It is so relevant, making me see endless possibilities for what I can do next. The curriculum keeps my mind open to various opportunities. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? The master's program is quite different from my bachelor's."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/sales-management/zoe,Zoe,Zoe (Part 2),"It focuses more on practical application in the real business world with a focus on marketing and sales. Although both programs are tech oriented, SAM teaches data analysis specifically for customers, markets, and competitors by leveraging transactional sales data, product mix data, and real time data. Moreover, there's a higher level of expectations here compared to my bachelor's. They want us to apply what we learn directly, often drawing from our own professional experiences. What are the biggest challenges in my study programme?Managing multiple group projects simultaneously can be quite challenging, especially when coordinating schedules among students with part-time jobs. Moreover, keeping up with extensive literature and the fast-paced exam schedule in quarters instead of semesters also adds to the workload. Finally, this degree challenges students by exposing them to pitching business projects and performing oral exams. What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?I wish I had known earlier that the program runs in quarters instead of semesters. This keeps us consistently busy as there are no breaks between quarters. As soon as exams end, the next quarter begins."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/sales-management/zoe,Zoe,Zoe (Part 3),"Also, I would've appreciated knowing that the emphasis leans more toward B2B sales than B2C, which wasn't clearly stated in the program description. I would prefer giving us the option to choose depending on what our career aspirations are. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?Once I complete my program, I intend to explore the startup world, focusing on business development and product launches in fashion and tech. For the foreseeable future, rather than seeking stability on a graduate job, I aim to explore diverse roles across various startups and pursue my own freelance projects. Lastly, I wish to collaborate with an international group of ambitious individuals from different majors and backgrounds. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Before starting, my advice to myself would be this: read the program's course descriptions thoroughly. In fact, when I first encountered the program, I almost passed it up due to its name as I thought that it would be only about making profit."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/sales-management/zoe,Zoe,Zoe (Part 4),"However, I'm grateful that I eventually delved into the course details and I realized that it is much more diverse offering endless opportunities regardless of the industry of interest and career focus."

The BADS programme is very unique in the sense that it specifically caters to those students. For most development master’s you will also need a bachelor’s in that area. I also wanted to move abroad for my master’s, as I believe there is no easier point in life to try to live somewhere else. CBS was a natural choice for me, as it’s quite renowned, it focuses on sustainability, and studying there is completely free for me. What do I like the best? think that would be my classmates and the general vibe in our programme. We are a pretty international programme, with only about a third of us being Danes. Everyone is super open and supportive of each other, and even though you might have different opinions in class, everyone gets along. Growing up in northern Germany, I expected everyone to maybe be a little cold and distant (which is often said that Danes are), however, that's not the truth."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/business-and-development-studies/andre,André,André (Part 2),"My classmates (including the Danes) are fun to be around and open, and we regularly meet outside class. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? The academic level definitely increased quite a lot! During my bachelor’s, I used to study very little throughout the semester and have stressful exam periods, which is not really possible for me anymore. The amount of readings you need to do is a lot, so I spend a lot of time reading up on papers and books in the library. In general, I feel like the level of teaching is very high, but not hard to follow if you're prepared for the class. The professors are also very supportive and eager to help you if you have any questions. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?I think that would be to keep a healthy work-life balance. Between classes, readings and working two days a week, I sometimes get pretty stressed out. I really liked the structure of my first semester in that regard, as it was split in the middle, so we had two exam periods. While the workload was similar, that really helped me be able to focus on specific topics and get used to the study climate at CBS."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/business-and-development-studies/andre,André,André (Part 3),"I also got to know some classmates to share the readings with, so I didn't have to read everything on my own. What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?First, that there is a restriction on how many ECTS you are allowed to do. I come from Germany where it’s possible to visit as many extra classes as you want, which is not a thing in Denmark. Therefore, you need decide quite early on how you want to use your limited ECTS, for example, for semesters abroad, internships, etc. Second, what the teaching culture is like in Denmark. You talk to professors on a first-name basis, and they are very nice and approachable. Coming from Germany, that is still something I'm getting used to. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?I am currently still considering if I want to start working or pursue a PhD after finishing my programme. However, both options are related to the field of development. If I start working, I would like it to be either directly in fieldwork or at development institute, NGO or in development consulting. I grew up speaking Spanish, so I would like to do something related to Latin America, but I am pretty open in regards to location."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/business-and-development-studies/andre,André,André (Part 4),"If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Don't stress out too much – first, in regards to moving abroad, and, second, when it comes to oral exams. Moving to Denmark was actually quite easy, and I’m still amazed at how efficient and digitalized the Danish bureaucracy is. They really make it easy for you, and we got a lot of information in our opening week at CBS. I didn't have to do any oral exams in my bachelor’s, so I was a little unfamiliar with what they were going to be like. The teachers are super nice though, the atmosphere is cozy, and it is definitely possible to get good grades."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/business-and-development-studies/nicklas,Nicklas,Nicklas (Part 1),"Meet Nicklas, a student from Business and Development Studies Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?Primarily, I chose my programme as it's a natural progression of my bachelor programme and thus presented the best opportunity, in my opinion, to further develop my skills and knowledge within the field I'd previously studied. I come from a bachelor programme with a strong emphasis on China, and so it would often be the Chinese context in which we were introduced to new knowledge. Therefore, I also chose this programme to experience and work with my field in other contexts than just China. What do I like the best?Most of our teachers have had practical research experience within their fields of expertise and actively contribute to the literature, which naturally influences our courses as well. Generally, our teachers have also been keen to draw on their professional networks and regularly invited guest speakers from e.g. start-ups in emerging economies or top-level managers from multinational enterprises. Furthermore, the amount of students is quite modest yet very diverse in terms of cultural background, which adds a lot of different perspectives."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/business-and-development-studies/nicklas,Nicklas,Nicklas (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? Even though people from my programme come from very different academic backgrounds around the world, the general expectations of you as a master student are higher, compared to being a bachelor student. To some extent, teachers expect that you have a predefined understanding of being a business student, and the workload on most of my courses has been heavier. Thus, it also takes more effort to achieve a high grade on your master's, in my opinion. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?It can be hard to maintain your foreign language, especially when you're in a country where you're not forced to use it on a daily basis. On the Asian concentration of my programme, the mandatory regional track course, which is Chinese mandarin in my case, is taught in English and so you have to be very disciplined and regularly spend time on improving and maintaining your language skills if you expect to make use of it after ended studies."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/business-and-development-studies/nicklas,Nicklas,Nicklas (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?I wasn't too sure about how high the academic expectations to the students were when time came for our first exams. I started panicking a little and doubting my own abilities, especially because everyone else on my programme seemed so capable. Everything worked out fine in the end, so go into your master’s programme with an open mind and trust the abilities that you have accumulated during your previous education. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?I'm open to work within most fields, and I see myself working in a larger international organisation that deals with sustainability and positive development in the markets they operate within. I haven't quite landed on a specific direction yet, but I'm keen on pursuing a job that allows me to use my knowledge about especially Asian markets. One of the good things about Business and Development Studies is that it touches so many disciplines that allow you to look for jobs in many different directions."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/business-and-development-studies/nicklas,Nicklas,Nicklas (Part 4),"If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…A master’s programme has a tendency to be much more career oriented, which is only natural as you narrow down the field you specialise in. Some might have a very clear plan for their career after graduation, maybe even have a full-time job lined up with their current employer, others might still not know exactly where they're going. Thus, it is easy to stress and compare yourself to others, so learn to focus on yourself and your own path, even if it's not clearly outlined yet."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/diversity-and-change-management/alexandra,Alexandra,Alexandra (Part 1),"Meet Alexandra, a student from Diversity and Change Management Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?After my Bachelor in Business Administration and Psychology at CBS, I knew that I didn't want to go the direct HRM route, but still wanted to be very focused on people in organisations. Throughout my bachelor programme, I tried to work the diversity angle into many of my papers, and so to me, Diversity and Change Management combines the best of business, organisation and people. I haven't been able to find a similar programme that was so specifically focused on diversity anywhere else. What do I like the best?My favourite part of this master’s programme is the academic content itself. While some of the readings are very long and complex, the subject matter itself is super interesting and full of nuances. Especially the field of diversity and the concept of D&I/DEI is relatively new, meaning that there are still so many things left to be discovered - I am constantly inspired and collecting possible topics for my final thesis. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? I think there is a noticeable difference in the academic level."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/diversity-and-change-management/alexandra,Alexandra,Alexandra (Part 2),"I was worried that there would be very specific expectations about prior knowledge, but because the students come from a wide range of academic backgrounds, some people are familiar with some concepts and others with other concepts. You are never alone in never having heard about some of the so-called ‘classics’. There is, however, a much higher expectation in terms of having critical reflections about the literature and how to apply theory to practice - lots and lots of case work! What are the biggest challenges in my programme?Learning to prioritise my time: Besides my studies, I also have a part time job and do volunteer work, so I need to be super organised with my time. I realised long ago that I won't be able to complete every reading, but it also bothers me because I genuinely think the literature is very interesting. I also don’t have as much time to socialise with my classmates as I was hoping I would, which is a challenge - particularly in terms of the language course, where I am more intimidated to speak with people I don’t know very well."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/diversity-and-change-management/alexandra,Alexandra,Alexandra (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?That everyone is nervous about the language courses, but also that people approach the master’s programme very differently. I think it’s a combination of previous studies and age, but some people prioritise their jobs over their studies, while others treat it as an extension of the bachelor’s and focus a lot on the social aspect. I think it is important to recognise that both approaches exist and are very valid, and thankfully I think everyone has a lot of respect for group work even if they are usually mostly focused on their jobs. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?Going into this programme, I had dreams of working in the EU, and I will be spending my third semester on exchange in Brussels, where I hope to learn more about the EU while also continuing to broaden my horizon in other academic areas. However, I think this programme opens a lot of doors, and would also be interested in working with DEI or in an NGO. Either way, I think the most important thing for me is to work in an international setting and to use my knowledge about diversity and inequality."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/diversity-and-change-management/alexandra,Alexandra,Alexandra (Part 4),"If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Don't be too scared of the language course and keep a note somewhere of possible thesis ideas! And if I had a chance to do it over again, I would probably also try to be more socially engaged, especially during the introduction week and during the first semester - it only gets harder to build a social foundation once everyone has settled into their own groups. Another thing I am currently trying to tell myself is to enjoy the programme as much as possible. Two years pass very quickly, and before I know it, I'll no longer be a student!"

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/diversity-and-change-management/mathilde,Mathilde,Mathilde (Part 1),"Meet Mathilde, a student from Diversity and Change Management Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?Diversity and Change Management has a strong focus on organisational and project management and leadership at a local and global/international context, which I aim to make my field of expertise. Furthermore, the courses offer discussion and analysis around various cultural, political and social issues, both at the organisation’s internal scale and external local context, which I consider highly valuable for an international career in management and leadership. What do I like the best?I really enjoy the freedom and opportunities that the programme gives: We get to choose our regional track course according to our field of interest. We also have the option to sign up for the Entrepreneurship and Private Sector Development in Uganda. Here we go on a field trip to Uganda for an immersive experience on business development in a non-European context, where we get to directly apply our research method. Moreover, we have many options to choose from on our 3rd semester between exchange, electives, minors, internship or even sign up for the CEMS programme."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/diversity-and-change-management/mathilde,Mathilde,Mathilde (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? The academic level on the master's is higher than on the bachelor’s – both in terms of workload regarding the readings and individual work as well as group work inside and outside of class. As the quarters go by really fast, the academic workload is much more compressed within a week than it used to be on the bachelor’s. However, I like the autonomy we are given to choose our exam themes. Most exams are written home assignments, and we get to choose our own research focus, which makes it easier, as we are truly passionate by the subject. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?I would say that what I struggled the most with in the beginning was organising my readings and projects. As the pace is quite fast during the first semester, especially due to the quarter set-up, I had a hard time managing all the readings plus the individual and group work for classes. But once we get into the pace, we slowly find our balance and it's all about being consistent in our studies. Having a study group can be a big help when it comes to sharing notes and even going through the readings together."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/diversity-and-change-management/mathilde,Mathilde,Mathilde (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?I would have liked to know just how fast-paced the first semester would be. We had classes for only 6 weeks for each quarter, and for each course we had to submit a first draft of our paper mid-quarter. This means we needed to have a research focus and a good understanding of theories and concepts by the end of the 3rd week of each course. If I had known that, I would have prioritised the theoretical readings over less essential ones, as I would have saved time. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?I would like to have an international career, so I my goal is to look for positions abroad, mainly in French-speaking countries, so I can put my intercultural and language skills to use. I am considering finding a first job in Denmark with connections to international markets, and then find contacts within that job to integrate another position abroad. So far, I’m mostly interested in project management and international politics. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Plan early, prioritise your readings and schedule your work, individual research and group work in advance."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/diversity-and-change-management/mathilde,Mathilde,Mathilde (Part 4),"Those were the elements that I struggled with the most when starting my master’s as I couldn't really evaluate the difference in workload between the bachelor’s and master’s. It’s important to find a good balance between the different types of studying (readings, personal research for projects and group work). I would say the most important is to find a technique and rhythm you are comfortable with, so you don't exhaust yourself."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/general-management-and-analytics/helen,Helen,Helen (Part 1),"Meet Helen, a student from General Management and Analytics Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I chose GMA because the programme offers a variety of different theoretical knowledge and capabilities which you can apply to a broad range of future career paths. The competency profile and the acquired knowledge was exactly what I was looking for as I wanted to gain a broader perspective into various business aspects such as management and data analytics. I personally enjoy learning about the intersection between business economics and data analytics, and then applying it in the context of problem-solving and decision-making. What do I like the best?I like that the courses we have are a combination of everything, ranging from strategy, analytics courses to finance and accounting. It gives you a broader perspective into different theoretical skills which you can apply to various roles and career paths. Another thing that I like a lot about the programme is the ""GMA Society"". We are a relatively large programme with a lot of students, so being able to do social activities with everyone where you get to meet students from GMA but who are in different classes is always exciting."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/general-management-and-analytics/helen,Helen,Helen (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?I definitely experience a higher academic level at my master's compared to my bachelor's. Majority of the courses are a progression from the courses I have had on my bachelor's, just more advanced with higher level of expectations for the exams. However, they are more in depth and cater more to my academic interests. There is also a lot more focus on group work compared to at the bachelor's level. What are the biggest challenges in my study programme?The biggest challenge is definitely the fact that it's a new programme. We don't have anything to compare it to in terms of expectations for the courses, or any guidance from previous students. Also, as someone who comes from a not-so-analytical bachelor, one of the things that is a bit intimidating for me specifically is the analytics part of the degree. However, that is what I look forward to learning about the most as I can imagine needing this skill for future work opportunities, which makes it quite exciting."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/general-management-and-analytics/helen,Helen,Helen (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?I think because it is a new programme, a lot of the things I would have liked to know before were simply not possible to know, as there hasn't been any students studying this before. It would have been useful to hear more about some great study techniques for exams, hear about the level of expectations and how to manage effective group work, especially when dealing with very different group dynamics. What I was most skeptical about was definitely the study environment and the career path that aligned with the programme once you graduated. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?After graduating I want to pursue a career within strategy, or management consulting, combined with business analytics. I know that I want to improve my efficiency in data analytics, which I have the chance to do so on this programme, especially with the options for minors as elective on the third semester."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/general-management-and-analytics/helen,Helen,Helen (Part 4),"However, I like to keep an open mind when it comes to career opportunities, and I believe that the GMA programme gives me that advantage due to the broad capabilities and theoretical skills you gain after graduating.If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Take the time in the beginning of the semester to find a great study group. Especially when majority of the exams and class assignments requires group work. Not only is it an advantage with the reading materials, note taking and motivating each other throughout the semesters, it also makes it a bit more fun. Helping each other out with study techniques and just overall having a group of friends you can rely on and work great with truly makes it feel a bit easier, especially during the ""tough"" periods."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/general-management-and-analytics/tore,Tore,Tore (Part 1),"Meet Tore, a student from General Management and Analytics Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?Having spent three years at CBS, I was already familiar with the vibrant social life the university offered. This positive experience motivated me to pursue further studies, and after careful consideration, I chose the GMA programme. What drew me to GMA was its unique emphasis on applying data, strategy, and finance for well-informed decision-making. Unlike some other masters programmes, GMA felt less theoretical and more aligned with real-world applications, making it a perfect fit for my academic preferences and values.What do I like the best?Being the first students in the GMA programme, I initially had some uncertainty about the course structure and how components would integrate. However, from the outset, it became evident that our dedicated professors, who designed the programme were very passionate about it. This enthusiasm shows in the classroom, where discussions and feedback are highly encouraged. Furthermore, it is a very large programme, but this has meant lots of opportunities for meeting other students. The social life in the programme has been positively surprising."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/general-management-and-analytics/tore,Tore,Tore (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?Moving from a bachelor's to a master's program brings a noticeable jump in academic level. The readings get longer and more, and some topics become really theoretical, making it difficult to see how they are supposed to be applied on real-life business cases. The workload is overall bigger, but with a bit of planning, it's completely doable. Even though it might feel a bit overwhelming at first, I found that the extra workload can be handled by staying organised and managing time well and, sometimes, through prioritizing which courses need more effort. What are the biggest challenges in my study programme?Navigating the study programme comes with its challenges. Firstly, the emphasis on group work is significant, requiring effective collaboration and coordination. Secondly, the first quarter is particularly demanding, packed with numerous classes that demand attention and work. Balancing coursework, a job, and maintaining a social life becomes a juggling act. It's practically impossible to read everything, making prioritisation of courses and personal/social life crucial."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/general-management-and-analytics/tore,Tore,Tore (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?Firstly, the emphasis on group work caught me by surprise. It's a big part of the programme and being ready for that collaboration would have been great. There are also more oral exams than on my bachelor's, which is something one needs to consider. Secondly, there were more classes than I anticipated, especially early on. Lastly, a clearer picture of what each course really involves would've been good. (Personally, I had read about the courses I was most interested in, which left a course or two, which I wasn't prepared for, whoops)What do I want to do after finishing my programme?After finishing the programme, I will be exploring opportunities within the realm of strategy and finance. While the exact path isn't crystal clear yet, I'm keen on roles that leverage the insights from the programme, allowing me to contribute to the firm I end up working with. The good part about GMA, is that it is a rather general programme, which allows one to explore many different career paths after finishing."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/general-management-and-analytics/tore,Tore,Tore (Part 4),"If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…If I could advise myself before starting the programme, I would emphasise early socialising; exam groups were formed quickly (within the first two weeks). I would ensure finding a group that aligns with the work methods and expectations I have. Also, don't stress excessively about the workload, ensure you savour the experience and strike a balance between work and enjoyment. The friends you make here are going to carry you through the next few years and might even be friends for life."

Even after having finished my bachelor’s in IBP as well, I’m still curious about the intersection between business, economics and politics. I am a naturally curious person and fascinated by the world around us. I think that if you want to (attempt to) try to understand it, understanding economic and political motives is probably the place to start. CBS is a great university in my opinion because of the academic standard as well as the student life. What do I like the best?My favourite part must be the people I am surrounded by in IBP, which inspire me on a daily basis. Many of them have an international background and plenty of interesting stories to tell. I highly appreciate being in an environment, where people are ambitious in their (school) work but also incredibly collaborative and social - and always up for a discussion. Of course, I also enjoy the contents we study on an academic level, and IBP challenges me to rethink my worldview."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-international-business-and-politics/jonna,Jonna,Jonna (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? I think there has definitely been an increase in the academic level, however, I don't think it was a major problem. The amount of self-learning prior to showing up in class increased. Class is more like a discussion rather than a lecture now. However, being someone that enjoys academic challenges and a bit of a competitive environment, I still feel like the level is manageable. Also, IBP presents an environment where people are collaborative and help each other out. One of the IBP slogans is ""sharing is caring"", and we really live by that. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?I think the reading load can be quite a lot, however, I am fortunate enough to have a great study group, so that we can share the workload. Many of us, including myself, also have student jobs as well as extracurricular engagement, so you become very good at scheduling and time management. I also think that the first-semester exam season was just incredibly long (more than 2 months), which was quite stressful for me. I am thankful to be back in the quarter structure this semester."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-international-business-and-politics/jonna,Jonna,Jonna (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?Having graduated from the IBP bachelor programme, in addition to being friends with students from higher years, as well as being a farsighted and well-researched person in general, I think I had a very good idea of the programme prior to starting. One thing I didn't expect was to find so many new friends on top of my friend group that continued from the bachelor’s. The people coming in from other CBS programmes as well as outside made for an amazing addition to the programme and were integrated within no time. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?I will take a gap year first, where I will need to do an internship (which is needed for me to complete my CEMS MiM double degree) and where I want to travel. After that, I want to work in sustainability consulting. I think that IBP provides an amazing basis for that, not only because it teaches you to think through complex systems in a very structured way, but also because you learn to be a good mediator between the business and the policy side. This is highly needed in the complex regulatory environment around sustainability governance."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-international-business-and-politics/jonna,Jonna,Jonna (Part 4),"If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Be open-minded, be curious and never stop asking questions. Also, don't be too hard on yourself. Everyone looks like they have it figured out, however, in the end we're all sitting in the same boat. I also think that you should join a student organisation at CBS, which is where I made a lot of friends. Being an international in the Danish social culture is not always easy, but in IBP, you're definitely lucky as everyone is by default a bit more open-minded and internationally interested."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-international-business-and-politics/mikkel,Mikkel,Mikkel (Part 1),"Meet Mikkel, a student at International Business and Politics Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I chose CBS and IBP for my master’s because I enjoyed my bachelor’s and CBS in general a lot. I wanted to continue the deep dive into the interaction between business and politics, and I was not able to find the same combination at other universities in Denmark. I also enjoyed CBS because there have been created opportunities to participate in several events arranged by the different student societies. This allows me to get the deep focus from my studies and touch new topics in the spare time. What do I like the best?I enjoy the diversification of topics that we cover. We are going from method courses that focus on how research and approaches can be helpful to solve a problem to courses with a full focus on business, politics and markets and lastly courses that combine the two. This has opened the world of how business and politics cannot be separated, and no matter where you'll end up, you will have to work with both. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? The intensity of the academic level and workload has increased."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-international-business-and-politics/mikkel,Mikkel,Mikkel (Part 2),"We are covering more ground in less time. But that’s also the great thing, as we are building upon our learnings from the bachelor, which only makes it more interesting, as you are not learning completely new material but always have some knowledge about the topic. The professors also assume that we are well informed about both the current world and the learning objectives from previous courses. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?The biggest challenges in my study programme is its ability to be concrete. Some courses can be very abstract and not very logical. This can be very intimidating for some students, including me, but when you finally understand it, the concepts from courses can be used in several other courses and real-life problems at a potential student job. This is both a challenge but also a great strength of the IBP master. What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?I would have loved to know which courses were new and which ones were old."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-international-business-and-politics/mikkel,Mikkel,Mikkel (Part 3),"The IBP study board is constantly trying to improve the programme, but this also means that the master students are sometimes the first cohort to experience a course, and this means that the professors aren't that prepared for how the formalities etc. for the course are, or what works well. Otherwise, almost everything I would need to know could be found online, courses, their exam forms, etc. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?I would like to go into either consulting or the energy markets. I find the IBP master’s extremely useful for attacking specific problems with a general knowledge and a tool box filled with ways of thinking and solving problems. Whether this is going to be management consulting or specific consulting on energy markets, time will tell. Energy markets are a general interest of mine, and the IBP master’s allows me to explore this in any given course as we can apply the courses to any topic we want. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…The advice I would like to give myself is to relax. You are going to be studying with so many smart and super nice people, and these people are doing a million interesting things."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-international-business-and-politics/mikkel,Mikkel,Mikkel (Part 4),"Don't rush and expect that you should or can do the same, but you are doing amazing stuff too. I think a lot of students, myself included, are stressing to get the perfect and most interesting student job or be president of the coolest society. Do what you want, and prioritise what you find the most value in. Don't stress about what others do."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/people-and-business-development/emilie,Emilie,Emilie (Part 1),"Meet Emilie, a student from People and Business Development Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?While studying at bachelor level at CBS, I found organisational sociology to be my favourite subject and something to look for in a master’s programme. PBD was a new programme, and therefore, it was difficult to figure out what to expect. However, during a live-introduction of the programme, a professor described how the courses should be thought of as more than ""just"" HR - it is about all the people processes that shape organisations. Therefore, this programme was a good way of continuing my education in the more human aspects of organisations. What do I like the best?The best thing about the programme is the focus of using larger projects and cases to develop competencies in understanding organisational people processes. We have actively worked with organisations to get a deeper understanding of how to solve issues that have root in the human aspects of organisations. For instance, while learning about digitalisation and people data, we worked with Novo Nordisk to develop digital solutions that could strengthen recruitment processes and on-the-job skill development."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/people-and-business-development/emilie,Emilie,Emilie (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? There is clearly an expectation that you come with a toolbox that contains certain elements, e.g. knowledge about how to properly conduct case-based project work using both quantitative and qualitative methods. However, there is less focus on reading heavy theory, which I found to be quite intense at my bachelor level - instead, energy is put into how to use what you have already learned actively, when trying to understand how a specific organisation functions. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?The structure of the PBD programme feels quite loose compared to what I was used to from my previous programme. You are the master of your own time, hold full responsibility for your own learning, and you develop your own projects without having many strict guidelines. When being used to more fixed structures and clear expectations, navigating a loose structure takes time to get used to and feels scary. However, it also gives you the opportunity to develop the specific competencies that you want and dive into areas that you find intriguing."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/people-and-business-development/emilie,Emilie,Emilie (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?Generally, there was little information about the programme prior to me starting, so knowing that it was very project-based, it still surprised me how much focus is put on this. I would have liked to know more about these projects, especially the large PBD-project, which you write during the 4th quarter. In a sense, you might describe it as a mixture of a school-project and consultancy work, and it takes much time and energy to align the expectations of the different stakeholders. Knowing this beforehand would make it less intense. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?PBD has sparked my interest in how to develop organisational capabilities through the people that constitute the organisation, and this I wish to work with. I wish to keep a sociological perspective in my future work, working with the interplay between workplace culture and the digitalisation of people processes. I find it interesting how digitalisation can change interactions between organisational members, while also giving access to a more diverse workforce - considering the effects such changes have on organisational culture."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/people-and-business-development/emilie,Emilie,Emilie (Part 4),"If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…First advice: To loosen up and go with the flow. Don’t be scared of the loose structure - in the end, you’ll come to like it, as it gives you the opportunity to pursue specific interests and choose which knowledge to obtain and competencies to develop. Second advice: to be social. You are not that many people, so you can easily get to know your entire class. Network in class to find the people that have the same interests as you, because it makes the project work so much more fun and fulfilling when you have a partner that is as passionate as you are."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/strategy-organisation-and-leadership/albin,Albin,Albin (Part 1),"Meet Albin, a student from Strategy, Organisation and Leadership. Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I've always been a proud generalist, and I felt like SOL would give me a broad and holistic education in a lot of the topics I think are interesting. I believe that the intersection of business strategy, organisational administration and leadership is at the core of management, and that's what I wanted to learn about. I chose to study at CBS because I've lived in Copenhagen for a while now, and I love the city. I know several people that had gone here before, and they all loved it. What do I like the best?I like that the courses leave you a lot of freedom to apply things to your own life or experiences. We discuss a lot in class and share our different perspectives, and that makes for a really holistic look on the topics we cover. I feel like I'm learning a way of thinking and approaching situations that I can apply to anything. It's really cool to see everyone in class engage as well, and because it's an international class, you get a lot of really interesting perspectives and ideas. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?"
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/strategy-organisation-and-leadership/albin,Albin,Albin (Part 2),"The master’s level is definitely more application focused. There's some repetition of some things that I had in the bachelor’s, but I guess that's necessary for everyone to be on the same level. The difference is that we move on from defining a concept to using it much faster. In my bachelor’s I felt like I was taught the basic tools that you need for working in business, and now I feel like I'm learning how to apply them and use them together with each other. It is a great build-up. What are the biggest challenges in my study programme?The biggest challenge is in a way the same as the biggest benefit. It's a broad, holistic and general programme so if you don’t spend the time and focus on applying things by yourself, it can feel a bit overwhelming or disconnected at times. I know people that feel like the programme is too theory based and too conceptual, and I've definitely felt like that as well. It's important to stay grounded, or sometimes it feels like you're going to take off. You do get used to it though. What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?That this education is very much what you make of it."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/strategy-organisation-and-leadership/albin,Albin,Albin (Part 3),"Don’t go in, thinking you can get away with passively absorbing things that someone tells you. Think actively and conscientiously about the things you learn. If I knew that going in, I might have set more clear intentions and maybe focused more on defining what I want to take these things and apply them to. It could have been good to go through the course catalogue some more and look for the connections and themes. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?After this programme, I feel like I have the freedom to move into almost every sector. I have always loved to solve problems and work in a fast-paced environment, so I’m looking to go into consultancy. I believe that this programme will give me a really good baseline of tools for approaching all kinds of situations. Because you get this generalist perspective of things, it feels like you can be yourself in any situation and sort of figure it out, and that's a really good feeling. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Be smart about how you read! Don't try to memorise every word, just try to understand the core concepts of every course, and then take that to a larger perspective."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/strategy-organisation-and-leadership/albin,Albin,Albin (Part 4),"Try to understand the connections, rather than just the theories. I have worked on reading and processing text in a way that lets me digest things much easier and faster than reading whole chapters or articles. When you learn to separate the important bits, you can start to put it all together much more intuitively."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/strategy-organisation-and-leadership/anna,Anna,Anna (Part 1),"Meet Anna, a student from Strategy, Organisation and Leadership. Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I chose to study SOL as it seemed like a programme that was able to offer great insight into the areas of strategy, organization and leadership. These were areas that I was focusing on and could see myself applying in my current and future work life, and therefore I thought it would give me an advantage to learn about the theoretical and academic stances of the areas. I chose CBS, as I had done my bachelor's here and preferred to continue with my master’s What do I like the best?What I like most about SOL is the variety of courses that use a lot of empirical cases to support the literature. The programme requires students to take on a lot of responsibility in regards to conducting an empirical exam case and using the theory that is being taught during the lectures. In this way, as a student, you gain a toolbox for thinking independently and ""solving"" real-life case struggles by using theory. Another thing I very much like about the programme is the social activities that are planned by the students. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?"
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/strategy-organisation-and-leadership/anna,Anna,Anna (Part 2),"As a student in the master’s, you must be prepared for a lot of reading, especially for the SOL programme. There is going to be a lot of literature before each lecture (books, articles, cases etc.). The teaching at SOL is also very interactive, which means that you don’t show up for lectures and solely listen. The professors very much expect that as a student you participate in class discussions. In this way, you may expect more preparation before class than previously experienced in the bachelor programme. What are the biggest challenges in my study programme?The biggest challenge in the SOL programme has been to collaborate in groups of five people to write a case exam project within the first two months of starting the programme. You must expect a lot of group work for the SOL programme, which may be a challenge to coordinate as most people have student jobs or spend time preparing for the lectures next to having to collaborate with students with all different academic and cultural backgrounds. What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?Before starting this programme, I would have liked to know how many of the exams are in groups."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/strategy-organisation-and-leadership/anna,Anna,Anna (Part 3),"This is where I believe that SOL really differentiates from many other programs, as you must be prepared to work and collaborate in groups of four-five people from different academic and cultural backgrounds for many of the exams. Another thing is how international of a programme SOL is – you can expect a lot of people from different countries around the world. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?After I graduate from my programme, I could see myself pursuing a career in management consulting. Based on the courses, the ways of working in the SOL programme and my current student job, I believe SOL prepares students well for what to expect and how to solve complex tasks in a real-life environment. I would like to travel and get to work in other cultures, in that way it is nice to hear first-hand experiences from some of my fellow students. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…If I could give myself a piece of advice before starting the SOL programme it would be to practise reading academic texts..."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/strategy-organisation-and-leadership/anna,Anna,Anna (Part 4),"After finishing the bachelor programme, you may think you are used to it, but I will say with the amount of readings before each lecture at the SOL programme, I had to find a new technique for reading and taking notes in order to get through all the readings. There are several ways, but I believe it is helpful to consider before starting the master’s programme."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/supply-chain-management/kasper,Kasper,Kasper (Part 1),"Meet Kasper, at student at Supply Chain Management. Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?Since high school, I have been interested in business operations, especially transportation and warehousing. Actually, my final assignment in high school was about logistic efficiency. I enjoy when people, processes and systems are working holistically together which made supply chain management the obvious choice for me. It is also cool to see how important it is in the real world with all the supply chain challenges that companies are facing: problems that are just waiting to be solved. What do I like the best?What I like best with the Supply Chain Management programme was the new perspective that was present. Studying HA Almen, I had the feeling that every course saw things from their own siloed views. However, supply chain management is about zooming out to get a broader overview. In other words, you learn about different aspects to help supply chains serve the end customers whether it is quantitative decision support or managing relationships. Personally, I do not believe that any other programme has such a broad viewpoint."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/supply-chain-management/kasper,Kasper,Kasper (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? There was a lot more freedom. For example, there were less lectures every week and usually only one exam for every course. However, this freedom meant that you were in charge of keeping track of the curriculum and being ready for the exams. There was not the same guiding hand compared to my bachelor’s programme. The reading was also heavier with more literary articles. All in all, you are expected to know different things about studying from your bachelor's degree. What are the biggest challenges in my study programme?There is a lot of reading every week, and I have difficulties remembering the content if I only read it once. This meant that I needed to spend all my time reading every week. My solution was a good study group, and by good I mean a well-functioning study group. Two friends and I shared all the reading and presented what we had read to each other every week. Consequently, I only had to read and write notes to one third of the curriculum. The two other thirds were delivered to me by my study group."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/supply-chain-management/kasper,Kasper,Kasper (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?In retrospect, I would have liked to know the full curriculum before the courses began. There is a lot to read if you want to keep up, and my study group and I were always a week behind, sometimes two weeks. I guess I am just the planning type of guy. I like to come prepared as much as possible. The techniques I developed during my two years would have been helpful in the beginning. For example, I developed a Gantt-chart for every article and chapter for each course with deadline and responsibilities. A cool tool for my study group and me. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?After my thesis is submitted and defended, I am starting as a consultant at Deloitte Consulting in the Supply Chain & Network Operations offering in August. Here, I will continue to work with companies to optimise how people, processes and systems work together. I am also inspired to spread the word of supply chain management as an alumnus. Maybe, I will teach supply chain management at CBS as an external lecturer. Who knows? But I will keep working with supply chain management for sure."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/supply-chain-management/kasper,Kasper,Kasper (Part 4),"If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Studying is so much more than getting good grades. If you only think about grades, you forget to have fun and learn. This is of course a personal opinion. For example, I had a blast writing a consultant-like exam about making a glühwein market in Germany logistically efficient during Covid-19, but I received an average grade in the end. However, this did not throw me off course because I remembered the fun of the challenge."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/supply-chain-management/naja,Naja,Naja (Part 1),"Meet Naja, a student from Supply Chain Management. Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?In the beginning, I was questioning whether to go for the Supply Chain Management or International Business programme when reading about them on the CBS website. I therefore attended online webinars hosted by students of the respective programmes and was more or less immediately attracted to SCM. This was mainly because the previous students highlighted a very practical and case-oriented approach in the lectures, but I also saw a pretty unique and relevant connection to the objectives of my bachelor’s degree (HA (fil.)). What do I like the best?What I like the best about SCM is definitely the social environment of the programme. People all come from different backgrounds, and I feel like there is a great sense of community. Further, I really like all the lecturers on the programme, as they are all very approachable and manage to make complicated learnings more comprehensible. The fact that I know what I can use the different theories and learning objectives for in the ""real world"" is also something that I want to highlight - you actually know how to contribute to practical cases."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/supply-chain-management/naja,Naja,Naja (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? I feel that the level of difficulty and complexity has definitely increased. The workload is larger and the exam periods have been more tightly planned. However, you also kind of learn that you don't have to read every single thing to keep up and get a good grade. For me, it has been all about understanding key concepts and theories as well as making a structured study plan, allowing myself to have some free time and take care of my student job. What are the biggest challenges in my study programme?One of the major challenges that I have faced on SCM was the Global Financial Analysis course on the first semester. I am for sure not a finance girl, so I spend a lot of time on the readings and exercises for this class. More generally, the planning of the exam periods have been a bit challenging for most people in the programme, as we had three exams within less than 2 weeks during the first semester. Here I would recommend getting started on exercises and readings early on in the semester to avoid work overload when exams are coming close."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/supply-chain-management/naja,Naja,Naja (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?If I should mention a few things, I think that I would have liked to know about the serious need for proper time management when facing exams. Also, as I have had a tendency to postpone solving the recommended exercises for excel-based classes, I would have liked for someone to tell me ""Hey, you're really going to love yourself for doing those exercises and understanding the logic behind them early on"". So I hereby pass that on. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?Currently, I am pretty open towards where I want to go after I graduate in June. Personally, I would love to pursue a career within consulting, as I believe that my acquired skills would come to a great use in this line of business. But I also think that it could be very interesting to get a job in the industry within strategic sourcing or procurement, probably within pharmaceutics or Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG). Or I will just travel the world for a few months in the fall, who knows."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/supply-chain-management/naja,Naja,Naja (Part 4),"If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…I feel like it's important to remember that everyone is in the same boat as you when starting a new study programme. Don't be afraid to reach out to new people or ask ""stupid"" questions. People are all nice, and you will for sure make great friends! Also, it's no shame to be overly ambitious and explorative when doing projects and exam papers. SCM is in my opinion a complex field of study, but this also works as an invite to be creative and challenge oneself."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-data-science/ines,Inês,Inês (Part 1),"Meet Inês, a student at MSc in Business Administration and Data Science. Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I decided to pursue this master’s degree after having done electives in the data science field. I understood how interesting it can be to extract insights from data and leverage it to help top management make wiser and more conscious decisions in businesses. Analysing this master programme and talking with past students helped me realise that the programme would provide me with a valuable toolkit to conduct analysis and with the skills to relate it to commonly faced business problems, so it is easily understood by people with non-technical backgrounds. What do I like the best?The international environment on the master’s is really nice. It allows you to meet people from all over the world. Additionally, the wide variety of backgrounds allows you to do group projects and other assignments during the master with people with different skillsets that are complementary to yours, which allows you to further develop your knowledge. This will not only allow you to leverage your strengths, but it will also allow you to work with people whose strengths are your weaknesses and they can teach you those."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-data-science/ines,Inês,Inês (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? I would say that the academic level in the master’s is way higher than in the bachelor programme. During the bachelor, despite busy periods and general stress related to exams and assignments, there was plenty of free time. However, in the master’s programme, we have constant assignments to be submitted, and the individual work that is expected to be done by the student is much higher. I would definitely say that in this master’s, there is a lot to keep up with, and it can easily become too much if you don’t manage your time wisely. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?The biggest challenge is definitely the speed to which you are expected to achieve a proficiency level of python and other programming languages. Coming from a non-technical background, my knowledge of programming languages was limited, but within a month of starting your classes, you are expected to have a good understanding of python and in the second semester, you are expected to be advanced user. This combined with constant assignments for each class can make it very challenging."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-data-science/ines,Inês,Inês (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?Before starting my programme, I would have liked to know how fast the teaching is for each class and how good you are supposed to be in coding in such a short period of time. For example, in the first semester, you start by learning how to print “Hello World”. However, in the next semester, you are already doing Machine Learning where the focus is on the algorithms and not the code implementation (but you still need to know how to do the implementation). What do I want to do after finishing my programme?I have not yet decided what I want to pursue when I finish my master’s. However, as of now, I can see myself pursuing a career as a data scientist or an IT consultant. Nonetheless, the career paths you can choose are many and varied, as this master’s provides you with a skill set that is highly demanded in different jobs, such as knowledge of R, Python, SQL, PowerBi, Tableau, Alteryx and others; which can be applied to different business areas. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…I would advise you to brush up on your coding skills, or start your learning process before the start of the master’s."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-data-science/ines,Inês,Inês (Part 4),"You do not need to have any prior knowledge of coding, however, if you don’t, the first semester is really busy and very challenging. Furthermore, I would advise you to work in different groups for each project and work with people that have complementary skills to yours to you maximise your learning experience."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-data-science/jan,Jan,Jan (Part 1),"Meet Jan, a student at MSc in Business Administration and Data Science. Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?During the two years of working before starting my master’s, I figured out that I wanted to study a programme that sits at the intersection of business and IT - and the Data Science programme at CBS does exactly that. It is perfect for people like me who are passionate about data science, but are more interested into its business applications instead of, for example, deep diving into small mathematical details. I also specifically chose CBS due to its reputation and contacts to industry-leading companies - and hugely benefited of both during my studies. What do I like the best?I really like that the programme always looks at data science topics from a business perspective - for example by going through case studies or by lectures given by industry experts. This way, you always get the feeling that what you are learning about is of relevance, and the skill set you acquire really is needed on the job market. Also, the programme gives a lot of opportunities to shape it to your individual needs."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-data-science/jan,Jan,Jan (Part 2),"You can easily go on exchange, integrate an internship or take classes at other universities in Copenhagen (DTU or ITU). How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? The difference was quite big in many aspects. I'm coming from a non-technical background (social sciences), which posed quite some challenges to get acquainted with very new fields of research I wasn't experienced with. Second, most of the classes in the Data Science programme come with multiple assignments during the semester which need to be passed in order to take part in the final exam. While this facilitates the learning processes throughout the class, I wasn't used to this examination form from my bachelor programme. What are the biggest challenges in my study programme?Coming from a non-technical background with my coding knowledge being based on taking a few online classes before starting this master’s programme, the biggest challenge definitely was about catching up in all the technical courses."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-data-science/jan,Jan,Jan (Part 3),"Yes, there are introductory classes in the beginning in order to bring everyone on the same level, but the pace picks up super quickly - so be prepared to put in the extra hours if you don't have that much of a technical background. But it is manageable and definitely worth it! What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?Retrospectively, the programme was more technical than I expected it to be before study start, considering that CBS is still a business school. This of course is nothing negative - in the course of the programme, I learned an incredible amount and always had the feeling that I was acquiring relevant skills. However, if I had known how technical it turned out be, I would have definitely invested more time in preparation (online coding classes etc.) before starting the programme, as it would have made the start a lot easier. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?A very long and very well deserved vacation ... ... after which I'll start as a Data & Analytics Consultant at one of the big consulting firms."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-data-science/jan,Jan,Jan (Part 4),"As this job is located directly at the intersection between business and IT and it requires acumen in both these areas, I think the Data Science programme sets a perfect foundation to succeed in this position. In general, I really want to continue in my work life what I am passionate about and why I studied Data Science at CBS: building a bridge between business and technology. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Studying a full-time master’s programme in an academic area I was new to while also working part-time on the side (which you kind of have to do as a foreigner if you want to afford living in Copenhagen) was tough. I was often stressed about never-ending to-do lists and a full calendar. If I could start again, I would tell myself to still prioritise a healthy balance of work/study life and social life and take more days off - after all, Copenhagen is still an incredibly beautiful and liveable city, which I at times forgot to enjoy."

By hiring a part-time master student your company gets highly qualified employee while they are still studying. They can contribute with: A part-time master is a commitment for all parties in terms of time, commitment and planning. For your employee it is a learning proces where the complexity and difficulty of the tasks should match what you would expect from an employee with a finished bachelor or diploma degree. The tasks themselves should reflect the competencies the student has and will develop during their 4-year master programme. Flexibility between work and studiesThe company is expected to include the student on the same terms as any other full-time employee. But at the same time there must be a level of flexibility to allow the student to prepare for and attend classes during the day and participate in exams."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/digital-business/ignacio,Ignacio,Ignacio (Part 1),"Meet Ignacio, a student from Digital Business Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I chose my programme in Digital business because I wanted to learn the business skills I lacked, and I thought that focusing on the digital aspect of it would be an effective way to differentiate me from other graduates. Also, I was a bit disappointed with my bachelor’s due to the difficulties of landing a job. I chose to pursue a master’s degree at CBS because of its international recognition and because they facilitate the process for international students. What do I like the best?What I enjoyed the most was the multidisciplinary approach to education: business, technology and law mixed altogether. I was able to combine the courses I enjoyed the most to follow a personalised path and avoid those courses I felt were not that necessary for the path I wanted to take. I also love the many opportunities that CBS brings to students to help ease the process of getting a first real and qualified job. I enjoyed the closeness of professors, where I could just call them by their name, as well as their availability to help. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?"
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/digital-business/ignacio,Ignacio,Ignacio (Part 2),"Firstly, the intense group work load. I wasn’t used to working in teams during my bachelor’s and that was the biggest difference during the master’s. Secondly, the long projects. I had to improve my time management skills for projects in which I had to work for over 3 months, compared to my bachelor’s where the projects required less time. Also, one of the things that made me realise that I wasn’t on bachelor level anymore was the freedom I got in relation to learning. It’s on the student to decide how deep you want to learn about something. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?My lack of knowledge of the technology aspects, i.e. programming. I had a hard time with the programming course where I had to retake the course. Also, I felt lack of introduction to those technology aspects – a lot is taken for granted. I didn't even know what blockchain was at the beginning of the programme! Lastly, making new friends was a real challenge. As the only one from Spain, it was difficult to become friends with people with other cultures from Northern Europe who can feel a bit ""cold"" at the beginning."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/digital-business/ignacio,Ignacio,Ignacio (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?I wished someone had advised me to seek academic guidance to get help on how I wanted to approach my own path. It was difficult for me to learn that I was responsible for creating the most coherent academic path and for deciding which courses were beneficial for me. Also, I wished someone had told me that it’s okay to fail. I had to make an alternative study plan myself with help from CBS. It’s okay to take longer to reach your goal and I wished someone told me that. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?I would love to land in a big corporation with international recognition. I would also love to work within the digital transformation industry. In essence, I want to build a career where my background in communication and digital business can coexist. I personally would like to work within the design industry, and Denmark is a great place if you enjoy the furniture design, which I deeply do. CBS taught me a lot about interesting corporations where I can see myself working. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Reach out to previous students."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/digital-business/ignacio,Ignacio,Ignacio (Part 4),"That step is essential for getting insights that are not available online. Get familiarised with technology topics - I remember everyone knew what blockchain or cryptos consisted of. I felt left out. Lastly, I would recommend joining a club that interests you. I personally joined the ""Design and Living club"", which helped me land a job within the jewellery industry where I currently am."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/digital-business/piraveena,Piraveena,Piraveena (Part 1),"Meet Piraveena, a student from Digital Business. Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?My bachelor at DTU was a mix between technology and business, and I find this aspect interesting and very up to date with the qualifications that are currently in demand. Furthermore, it is possible to study this master’s part-time, so I can work full-time on the side, which allows me to test the knowledge that I am receiving at CBS almost instantly. I think a part-time master’s allows me to work and study exactly in the balance that I want, and honestly I hope to see more master’s where this is possible. What do I like the best?I enjoy that there is project work as well as the more traditional classes. It gives us the opportunity to apply the knowledge in a realistic setting. Most corporate jobs now have some type of project work, and it’s good to already be comfortable with and learn how to cooperate in this type of work. The diversity of the students is really great too, as not everyone is from CBS. You get to meet students from other countries and other universities, and they all have different ways of approaching a case study - which is really helpful."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/digital-business/piraveena,Piraveena,Piraveena (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? At DTU, the classes were more frequent and a lot longer. At CBS, there are not that many classes, which is fine, as the classes seem more focused. At my bachelor’s, we also had several assignments that had to be handed in prior to the exams. At CBS, I have only experienced assignments that made sense and helped up be ready for the exams, which I appreciate a lot more. What are the biggest challenges in my study programme?I believe the law aspect is an unfamiliar territory for me. It has been difficult understanding the EU Internet Laws, and applying them to case studies is harder than you would think. It’s a new way of reading and understanding for me, but the professors are good at conveying the laws, and I found the subject surprisingly interesting, as it’s about all the cases we see and hear about in the news. What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?I believe I have been well-informed from the get-go. Perhaps for the part-time students, I would recommend having a chat with your company supervisor or school supervisor to plan how work and school will balance out."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/digital-business/piraveena,Piraveena,Piraveena (Part 3),"It’s a bit tricky in the start, and you need to be a good planner and make sure you have time to attend classes and find a project group that can meet after work hours. I was really lucky to find a group that is supportive and flexible towards my work schedule. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?I’m starting in a new position as Project Manager at Novo Nordisk at Global IT. I believe this master’s is a perfect match for this position, and I hope to have become an even better project manager with this master’s. I want to work in a cross-field between technology and business. I enjoy technologies that are designed to help people and make our current work processes more efficient. Ultimately, freeing time from workers to spend on family, hobbies or immerse their time into a subject at work If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…It is important to balance your socials with work and school. Immersing yourself into work or school 100% is for me at least an unhealthy balance. You can have all three things but it does require prioritizing and make sure your are not too burdened."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/digital-business/piraveena,Piraveena,Piraveena (Part 4),"Especially, with doing the part-time, have ongoing chats with your manager about the work load and make sure that important deliveries do not clash with your exams"

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-information-systems/malgorzata,Malgorzata,Malgorzata (Part 1),"Meet Malgorzata, a student from Business Administration and Information Systems. Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I decided to pursue this master's programme to continue my journey with connecting business and IT. In the current pace of digitalisation worldwide, I believe that having technical skills and understanding, on top of a business background, is crucial for navigating the world and making an actual difference in the industries we decide to engage in. The Information Systems degree combines the two worlds, allowing every graduate to choose their own path no matter if it’s technical or business related. What do I like the best?Perhaps most importantly, the programme gives students the opportunity to apply the knowledge they gather immediately in their work and daily lives. This is a key aspect of relevance, as it allows students to see the tangible benefits of their education in real-time. Another benefit of the focus on relevance is that it allows students to explore and reflect on different problems and dilemmas from a variety of perspectives. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?"
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-information-systems/malgorzata,Malgorzata,Malgorzata (Part 2),"This master's degree compared to the bachelor's is not much more difficult. However, it builds upon certain theoretical knowledge obtained previously. How each student experiences the academic level is in my opinion quite subjective, as it very much depends on what additional knowledge was obtained e.g. at work or throughout electives. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?It's difficult to identify specific challenges related to this programme, as it can vary depending on individual skill sets and personal interests in the various courses. What can be challenging for one student may not be for another. However, it's important to note that the programme is designed to be challenging in order to ensure that students are well-prepared for their chosen field and real-life problems, which are often complex to manage. What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?I would like to have known what exactly to expect from a master's degree. While it may seem intimidating at first, it's important to remember that a master's programme is designed to build on the knowledge and skills you've already acquired through your bachelor's degree or professional experience."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-information-systems/malgorzata,Malgorzata,Malgorzata (Part 3),"For bachelor students from CBS, it's worth exploring the academic overlap between courses in order to make the most of your education. This can help you to make more informed decisions and progress quickly and efficiently through the programme. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?After completing this degree, I plan to continue my journey in the field of product management, Agile and leadership. I currently work in this domain, but I aim to develop my skills and knowledge further in order to become an advisor in these areas. By pursuing additional training, gaining experience and building my network, I hope to achieve my long-term career goals and make a meaningful impact in the field. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…If I could give myself a piece of advice before starting a master's degree, it would be to take the time to reflect on my goals and motivations. This includes understanding why I want to pursue a master's degree, what I hope to gain from the experience, and how it fits into my overall career and personal goals."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-information-systems/malgorzata,Malgorzata,Malgorzata (Part 4),"I would advise myself to stay open-minded and curious throughout the programme and to take advantage of the many opportunities available for learning, networking and personal growth."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-information-systems/nikita,Nikita,Nikita (Part 1),"Meet Nikita, a student from Business Administration and Information Systems. Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?After studying abroad for my bachelor’s, I was interested in Scandinavian culture within the IT sector and had previously heard about CBS. After doing some research and looking into the course material, I felt the material, such as Internet of Things and AI & ML, was quite relevant in terms of what I would like to dig deeper in, as well as an exciting opportunity to see if I would like to have a career in Denmark. What do I like the best?One of the great things about CBS is that it not only provides insightful academic material and classes for students, but also valuable career perspectives. For instance, professors often invite relevant guest speakers to share their work experiences, and this helped me understand how academic theories can be applied in real-life scenarios. Also, having the opportunity to join the CBS IT Union and arrange workshops and events with outside organisations was a great experience. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?"
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-information-systems/nikita,Nikita,Nikita (Part 2),"During my first semester, I found that some of the academic topics covered in certain courses were familiar to me, while others were a bit more challenging to me compared to my peers. At first, I felt like I was playing catch-up, but over time I began to understand the academic lingo and topics more and more in each class session. Eventually, I was able to grasp these concepts more fully and felt more comfortable with the coursework as semesters went by. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?Many courses in this programme require group projects, which could be challenging into working effectively in terms of different work schedules, expectations and ideas that could lead to underwhelming results if not communicating properly. As previously mentioned, some of the course material was challenging for me at first and learning a new coding language in Big Data Management and AI & ML became an obstacle that I had to overcome. What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?Looking back on my experience in the programme, I realize that I would have benefited from more information about the internship opportunities available in the third semester."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-information-systems/nikita,Nikita,Nikita (Part 3),"It would have been quite insightful to know more about the academic culture in Denmark to compare to my previous learning experiences and to understand the overall exam structure at CBS and to then sum up my own expectations. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?Once I complete my studies, my goal is to stay in Copenhagen and find a full-time IT position that aligns with my interests, skills and the specialisation that I would like to build upon. Specifically, I'm hoping to specialise in one of three areas: renewable energies, offshore IT or technology consulting. My aim is to find a role that allows me to grow professionally while contributing to a more innovative and tech-driven future. Also, play lots of padel. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…During my studies, I've learned that having a structured approach to consuming course content is essential to getting the most out of the material. By creating good note-taking habits and breaking down the material into manageable chunks, I've been able to better understand and retain the information I'm learning."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-information-systems/nikita,Nikita,Nikita (Part 4),"Additionally, I've come to appreciate the importance of taking advantage of every career opportunity that comes my way. Another lesson I've learned is to not be self-conscious about sharing my ideas in class discussions."

The programme provides a strong foundation in business strategy, entrepreneurship and innovation management – valuable skills for many business-related jobs. The MIB programme enables me to develop entrepreneurial skills such as opportunity recognition, resource allocation and risk management, and these are essential for success in today's business environment. What do I like the best?I like that the MIB programme is designed to be highly practical, focusing on real-world projects, case studies and partnerships. This means that the lectures are more engaging and relevant to my career goals and dreams. Also, I enjoy meeting many international students in class! This gives me the opportunity to learn about other cultures while practicing my English speaking. Last but not least, I like that we master's students also get the opportunity to go on an exchange abroad during the 3rd semester. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?"
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/management-of-innovation-and-business-development/matilde,Matilde,Matilde (Part 2),"I believe that the academic level is higher in the MIB master’s programme compared to the HA PRO bachelor’s programme. The amount of reading is more significant compared to the bachelor’s, but the field itself is more exciting now because the master’s programme is more specialised and provides in-depth knowledge within the area I’m interested in. It’s also remarkable that your performance is expected to be high - both in class and for the exams during the semesters. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?I expected that the biggest challenge for me would be that everything was in English. I knew in advance that there would be many international students, so I was prepared to speak a lot of English. I was most nervous about the oral exams, which take place in English exclusively, but luckily it never became a real concern as I quickly got used to speaking and writing English daily. The most difficult thing about the MIB programme is that it‘s a time-consuming study, which means that I don’t have the opportunity to work as much as before. What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?You will not avoid corporate finance - even with the MIB programme!"
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/management-of-innovation-and-business-development/matilde,Matilde,Matilde (Part 3),"Honestly, it was not my favourite course in the HA PRO bachelor, so I was happy when I saw that there was only one course about finance in MIB. But hey, once you've gone through corporate finance on your bachelor's degree, luckily, it’s straightforward! Overall, I think it’s essential to consider the various specialisations well in advance so that you can choose the one that best suits your career goals and interests. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?After finishing my master’s programme, I would like to start a career in consulting – preferably in strategy, business development or business transformation. I like the idea of helping and advising clients to create value for their stakeholders. On the other hand, I can also imagine working as a project manager in an organisation that works on innovative or development projects. This can include anything from leading a development team to implementing new technology. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…It is the last two years - unless you intend to complete a PhD - that you will be studying, so enjoy the flexibility and identity of being a student."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/management-of-innovation-and-business-development/matilde,Matilde,Matilde (Part 4),"I have always been very busy working alongside my studies, but now I believe that our studies equip us to become skilled business people. You will probably get plenty of opportunities to work long hours when you graduate. Your studies should not be completed rashly, but should be enjoyed!"

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/management-of-innovation-and-business-development/petr,Petr,Petr (Part 1),"Meet Petr, a student from Management of Innovation and Business Development Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?It was quite challenging to choose a programme. Firstly, there were a number of interesting programmes. Secondly, it was hard for me to get a proper idea of how the study programme would look like just from the written description, so I relied a bit on my gut feeling and decided on the Management of Innovation and Business Development, as I perceived ""Innovation"" as something cool, interesting and useful for my future career. What do I like the best?One of the things I really like about studying MIB is that we have a lot of case studies where we can not only apply the knowledge we learned during the lectures, but also read about interesting ideas, innovative products and exciting stories from the business world. It is also nice to discuss the case in class, as it gives you new perspectives on the problem and its possible solutions. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? So far, I have experienced a very different approach to studying than on my bachelor's."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/management-of-innovation-and-business-development/petr,Petr,Petr (Part 2),"For example, I used to have around seven courses at the same time, whereas here at CBS, I only have two courses, which helps me be more effective in my studies. Another big difference is that there is a lot of academic reading for each lecture, which is quite time-consuming, but sometimes also interesting. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?For me, it was probably the transition from more of an individual style of studying to a heavily group-focused studying. It was especially challenging, as I’m not much of an outgoing person, making it a bit harder to find a study group at the very start. During the group work itself, it is also a bit challenging to align with each other, as each member has different expectations of how to approach the project. What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?It is rather just a fun thing, but I think it is worth knowing before taking the first oral exam. In the Czech Republic, the students are expected to wear a suit/dress for oral exams. But apparently, here in Denmark, there is no such dress code, and the students wear their casual clothes to the exam."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/management-of-innovation-and-business-development/petr,Petr,Petr (Part 3),"So if you don't want to feel overdressed, make sure to leave your suit in the wardrobe and stay in casual clothes. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?I am not fully decided yet as there are multiple paths I find very interesting. Furthermore, the MIB programme has quite a broad focus, thus doesn't really push me in a specific direction. Personally, I consider it to be quite a big advantage as it gives me time to try working in different positions as a student worker and to make a final decision after finishing my studies and having better idea of what I like and dislike. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…I would advise myself to pick the most interesting programmes and try to sneak into a few lectures and maybe even talk to some of the students to get a better idea of what it is like to study the chosen programme. Furthermore, I would stress the importance of being social from the very beginning, as there will be a lot of group work, and it's nice to form a group with people you know and like."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-bioentrepreneurship/aaron,Aaron,Aaron (Part 1),"Meet Aaron, a student from MSc in Business Administration and Bioentrepreneurship Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I really appreciated the 2-year intensive syllabus to understand many facets of bioentrepreneurship. The option to combine an internship with the thesis in order to gain practical experience was a definite stand out to me. It was the combination of these two key factors coupled with Denmark being a key player in the life science industry that urged me to choose my programme. I am an international student and I love experiencing new cultures, this was also a key deciding factor in choosing Copenhagen. What do I like the best?I liked the concept of reinforcing my scientific acumen first and then gradually transitioning to a more bio-business-oriented course. This makes me gain a good firm understanding of general science although one could tailor it based on their likeness. This flexibility the programme offers in choosing units made this programme a lucrative choice with a good balance of business and science overall to facilitate active interdisciplinary learning among the student body."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-bioentrepreneurship/aaron,Aaron,Aaron (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?The level is slightly amplified due to a difference in teaching patterns and the fact that a block lasts only 2 months makes the experience feel more intensive. The teaching style is vastly different too, with my present program being more grounded in the basics and placing an emphasis on overall learning. This felt like a vast difference initially and can impact how one perceives the difference in the ""level"" of their previous course to their current course. What are the biggest challenges in my study programme?Getting accustomed to the block system and longer than usual lecture durations was a big challenge for me initially as it took a different kind of preparation and planning in advance. This was especially challenging as an international in Denmark as there were requirements to acquire my residence and healthcare-related requirements while balancing my education. This can be overcome but just takes some getting used to. Additionally, the lack of practice in oral exams made the testing of my courses harder as it wasn't something I was used to."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-bioentrepreneurship/aaron,Aaron,Aaron (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?I opted for this program with an open mind willing to experience the challenge of transitioning between professional backgrounds. However, I wish I networked more with my peers from previous batches to understand the complexities of student life with this program and for any tips and suggestions. Additionally, the requirements demanded of the compulsory ""Big data in Biotech"" module was percieved to be higher than stated, and being the first course was more challenging and confusing than anticipated. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?I currently have no solid plans, however, life science-related consulting is a top choice for me at the moment. I aspire to be connected to the Bio-innovation sector that bridges science, innovation and business with the aspects of commercialization. Translating innovation to impact is a goal of mine and is something I aspire to have involved with my career. The purpose of choosing my course was to discover how I can best apply this to a range of professions."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-bioentrepreneurship/aaron,Aaron,Aaron (Part 4),"If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Discovering an effective routine and work ethic even before starting would be ideal to better transition into the work-intensive course it can be. Maybe also establishing strategies to better my work-life balance based on my priorities could have been done in more depth. This would take some introspection so that I stay on top of my work but still establish a good work-life balance and cater well to my hobbies and interests."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-bioentrepreneurship/amalie,Amalie,Amalie (Part 1),"Meet Amalie, a student from MSc in Business Administration and Bioentrepreneurship Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I chose the BIO programme because it provides me the opportunity to explore the field of life science innovation and its potential for future career opportunities. What drew me to CBS was the opportunity for a second-year internship at a biotechnology company, offering hands-on experience. This programme allows me to further build on my academical career within biology while at the same time equipping me with new skills within business and entrepreneurship, which i believe will give me a competitive edge as I step into my career. What do I like the best?I like that I have the opportunity to tailor and optimize my degree according to my strengths and interests, due to the wide choice of elective courses in the first year. The programme has a very diverse curriculum, although heavily oriented around biology in the first year. In the second year the programme transitions into to more business-oriented courses, which I am also very excited about. Overall, the flexibility and quality of the curriculum makes this programme an ideal fit for my academic and career aspirations."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-bioentrepreneurship/amalie,Amalie,Amalie (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?Moving from my bachelor's to the master's programme meant taking more ownership of my learning. I have definitely noticed that more self-study is required, but with more independence comes a greater opportunity for personal growth and development. However, it did feel like a natural transition coming here from my undergrad, and there is an abundance of resources to help you along the way, should you ever feel overwhelmed. What are the biggest challenges in my study programme?I think the biggest challenge lies in the short 8-week duration per course. This means that the overall atmosphere is quite high-intensity, which requires a lot of focus and effective time management in order to keep up with the course. I have found that establishing a good routine has become crucial to balance academic life with my life outside of university. Once you get adjusted to the tempo, you realize that it is indeed a very effective way of learning, more so than having four final exams at the end of a semester."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-bioentrepreneurship/amalie,Amalie,Amalie (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?Before joining the programme, I wish I had known more about the practical experiences offered. Exploring more internships opportunities or industry connections could have helped shape my course decisions. Also, exploring student job opportunities beforehand would have been beneficial, considering the abundance of possibilities available. Luckily, job offers are posted continuously, so the chance definitely isn't lost despite not landing a job early in the semester. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?I am still exploring my options, but I am drawn to innovation roles in the biotech industry - product development within the food industry and eco-innovation initiatives are some of the areas I find appealing. Mostly I am excited about the vast range of possibilities, which I have come to discover by connecting with various companies through opportunities made possible by the BIO programme. This exposure has offered insights into diverse industries and the opportunities within. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Trust the process and enjoy being a student while you can."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-bioentrepreneurship/amalie,Amalie,Amalie (Part 4),"Engage with your peers and professors and stay curious. Stay open to new experiences, ask for help when needed, and remember that it's okay not to have all the answers from the start. Prepare for the lectures as best as you can, it will make them so much more durable to sit through. This is your chance to grow and evolve—make the most of every opportunity."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msocsc-in-organisational-innovation-and-entrepreneurship/dominik,Dominik,Dominik (Part 1),"Meet Dominik, a student from Organisational Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?Coming from a more general bachelor's degree in business administration, I was looking for a collaborative and creative environment to dive deeper into innovation management. In addition, developing business concepts has always fascinated me. The more case-based approach of CBS combined with the inspiring course descriptions of OIE felt like the perfect combination to learn more about both innovation management and entrepreneurship and apply it directly to real-life scenarios. Doing all of this abroad felt like a must-have experience. What do I like the best?For me, the best part of OIE is the people in the class, the network that surrounds it and the opportunities that arise from it. The opportunity to discuss real cases with a class full of proactive, open and creative individuals makes OIE the right master’s programme for me. I really enjoy hearing diverse viewpoints in class and collectively discussing a suitable solution for the case at hand. Moreover, I like that OIE exams are a mixture of written sit-ins, individual and group projects as well as oral exams."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msocsc-in-organisational-innovation-and-entrepreneurship/dominik,Dominik,Dominik (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? Personally, I think OIE is what you make of it. A lot of the courses are more practical in nature, resulting in either group projects or a focus on applying theory to cases. In my undergraduate studies, I was much more focused on reproducing what I had learned for my exams. Instead, most of the time at OIE, I have to come up with my own tailored solutions to a given situation or case where there is no one answer. Being comfortable to discuss alternative approaches in a group setting is definitely a benefit when studying OIE. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?For me, the biggest challenge of the master’s is to take responsibility for the freedom I have been given. OIE gives you the opportunity to explore so many different directions. In terms of your life after graduation, it is a big challenge to identify what you really want and derive the right steps towards your goals. To be more concrete: when you are given the opportunity to work on your own start-up idea, you can see it as an exercise, or you can try to make it as realistic as possible to get the best learning out of it."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msocsc-in-organisational-innovation-and-entrepreneurship/dominik,Dominik,Dominik (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?I thought OIE would focus more on innovation management. But innovation only occurs through successful implementation of good ideas in businesses. This naturally leads to the tendency that OIE is more focused on entrepreneurship. The programme teaches you how to successfully turn your ideas into desirable and feasible business models, and puts less emphasis on the viability part of it. OIE focuses more on qualitative discussions about entrepreneurship. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?I would never exclude the prospect of starting my own business and pursuing my own idea. For that to happen, there has to be a good fit between the idea and my skills and aspirations. That is why I currently see myself as an innovation consultant, service designer or workshop facilitator, helping other organisations to tackle their business challenges in a creative and collaborative way. I want to use my creativity, entrepreneurial spirit and empathy to design the solutions of tomorrow. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…"

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msocsc-in-organisational-innovation-and-entrepreneurship/miranda,Miranda,Miranda (Part 1),"Meet Miranda, a student from Organisational Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I choose this program because it links theory with practice. I really like how each semester builds on the previous and the classes we have interlink also during the semesters. Everything we learn is used in discussions or through exercises. We get to test the theories, methods, and approaches we read about. We get to try, fail, and succeed, each aspect promotes my understanding of how they are applied in the real corporate world. What do I like the best?There is no hierarchy between the students. We are all here to learn. Everyone brings something different with them from their bachelor degrees, job experiences, languages they speak, and cultures. Everyone is open to other opinions and experiences, and that really shows during the class discussions. I was not expecting the course to be as socially inclined as it is. So, I have overall been very positively surprised with everything about the programme thus far."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msocsc-in-organisational-innovation-and-entrepreneurship/miranda,Miranda,Miranda (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?My bachelor degree was very theoretical and detail oriented, with a lot of academic readings of plausible scenarios, which to some extent came rather easy to me. This programme has pushed me out of my comfort zone in that it has made me rethink my habitual approaches to problem-solving. Getting to practice what is being read and preached, even though the academic level is quite high, the stucture of the lectures and the studio classes makes me understand the complexity of the material through experience. What are the biggest challenges in my study programme?In one of my two first classes we were told to work on our projects in groups, and each week we were told to discard our progress and think of our project from a new angle. At first this was very frustrating, because we had to create a product by the end of the course. However, when writing the exam, I had a more profound understanding of the different methods that I then had to evaluate, both from a theoretically point of view and from my own experience with using them."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msocsc-in-organisational-innovation-and-entrepreneurship/miranda,Miranda,Miranda (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?The exams are structured in a vastly different way than I was used to from my previous institution of study. Had I known that I would have prepared differently for, especially, the sit-in exams. Specifically, I would have created notes with key quotations that could be used during the exam. The quarter structure makes each course extremely compact and intense - So missing one class means you miss out on a lot of important information on the topics. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?I would love to work in quality assurance of the value chain within or related to the field of construction. As I am keen on systems and operational strategies, my passion for optimizing the use of resources pairs well with the tools and knowledge I am gaining by being in this programme. One of the reasons why I chose this programme was to get a more in-depth understanding and experience with the different nuances of the operational processes of innovation and how that plays with the different segments of the value chain and as a whole."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msocsc-in-organisational-innovation-and-entrepreneurship/miranda,Miranda,Miranda (Part 4),"If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…I would give myself the advice to be less worried with rules and regulations, and not to be hesitant when given a strange exercise in class. I have come to realize that those are a regular part of the course, and it keeps me on my toes regarding the materials. Ask as many questions as you can. The professors know that the topics are complex and there is no shame in asking in class or emailing them when you get home or while you are studying. - They are all more than excited to enlighten you with their knowledge."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-philosophy/astrid,Astrid,Astrid (Part 1),"Meet Astrid, a student from MSc in Business Administration and Philosophy Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?Interesting combinations of subjects and the level of the teaching, drew me to and has kept me at CBS. I yearned to be in a place where I could explore critical and alternative perspectives on how business is conducted. Feeling like many economic premises were implicitly political and powerful, I wanted to go beyond surface accounts of this and explore questions that would take me to the root of the arguments. What do I like the best?Easily, it's the people! Based on the experience in my bachelor's, I didn't expect that I would enter a class where I would feel genuine care for all my classmates. Through developing close friendships from day one, I was luckily proven wrong. We even got an amazing unexpected travel opportunity, as we got to visit and work with organisations in Venice in the 1st semester. As a small cohort with people from different academic and cultural backgrounds, I find it an inclusive yet intellectually stimulating space. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?"
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-philosophy/astrid,Astrid,Astrid (Part 2),"On the master's, I find that we get to delve more in-depth into the topics that we work with, as the courses are more specific and the readings more advanced. I spend approximately double the amount of time on readings now, and I find that working thoroughly with them before classes gives a larger pay-off compared to during my bachelor's. Generally, I'm a lot more of an active participant in class now, which supports my learning. I also get to apply many of the insights in real time through my involvement in the Business Unusual at Station, the Student Innovation House next to CBS. What are the biggest challenges in my study programme?Self-definition and learning how to leverage your education in a job search is tricky, as there are fewer concrete methods and hard skills acquired. In the programme, we're covering a lot of academic ground in a short time span. Therefore, you rather quickly have to learn how to read and apply philosophical writings when you're coming from a different discipline. But with the support of very competent professors and good classmates it is absolutely doable and opens up a profound level for analysing concepts within just about any discipline."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-philosophy/astrid,Astrid,Astrid (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?There are some practicalities that are good to know. The first round of applications for exchange is very soon after beginning your studies, so look into it early. The possibility of doing an internship cannot take up the whole of your 3rd semester, as it's 15 ECTS maximum. And most students write their thesis in pairs, which can be good to keep in mind when you start thinking of questions and topics of interest for the project. Also, the first year (when the class is gathered) flies by, so be present, take initiative and make the most of it! What do I want to do after finishing my programme?Some of my deep interests are related to social and environmental sustainability, and I can see myself working with these topics on a daily basis. I could imagine that international public governance or social innovation and entrepreneurship would be settings in which I thrive, so that's what I will seek out after graduating. These may well be pipe dreams, and I believe the road is laid while we walk it. Most things make sense in retrospect I think, so I'm open to trying my hand at different jobs. That's a true perk of being a generalist."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-philosophy/astrid,Astrid,Astrid (Part 4),"If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Share what you learn with people inside and outside of your studies! It’s important and interesting for many to think about and discuss the underlying logics of how we organise, and it helps you solidify insights you get in the courses. And don't be deterred from speaking - no one has all the answers! Try to carve out as much time as possible for the studies, it's more fun and rewarding as a full time student than trying to balance it with many other commitments simultaneously. A game plan also wouldn't hurt, instead of operating day-to-day."

So I was very surprised to feel so excited when I first read about the Business Administration and Philosophy programme. It seemed like it would give me the toolbox to properly understand the dynamics of business and society and with that put forward a more qualified and, especially, constructive critique. I chose the program because of its boldness to question the very foundation of the mainstream business curriculum. What do I like the best?It excites me how critical thinking is built into almost all aspects of the programme or at least is implicitly expected from the students at this programme. Furthermore, I like how the programme doesn’t just teach you theories, but essentially teaches you how to think. I believe that’s why I don't experience my studies as exclusively preparing me for the job market, but as an education in becoming better at understanding the world we live in."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-philosophy/kirstine,Kirstine,Kirstine (Part 2),"Also, I like that we are a minor group of students in the programme, which increases the general engagement. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? I experience that the academic level hasn’t increased as much as expected. It varies from course to course, but in general I am slightly disappointed with the academic level on the master’s. So far, we still spend a lot of time in the lectures on a quite explanatory level. I guess coming from the BSc in Business Administration and Philosophy, I thought we would be moving on faster to higher levels of abstraction on the master’s. The good thing is, though, that students from other bachelor programmes seem to pick up on BSc in Business Administration and philosophy’s line of thinking fast. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?The biggest challenge is for my (and most of my peers’) personal engagement in the programme to keep up with the progression of the courses and not be able to go as deep into the themes as desired. We are introduced to some of the greatest philosophical texts and ideas and have only a singly lecture to work with it in class before we move on to the next."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-philosophy/kirstine,Kirstine,Kirstine (Part 3),"Often we have as much time to grasp complex philosophical concepts, as we have to go through business cases, which can be challenging as the 'business' part of CBS suddenly becomes quite evident. What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?My initial impression of the programme is aligned with my experience both at the bachelor and the master’s programme, so there has been no surprises as such. It has been very positive to experience how much at eye level most of our lecturers have been, which is very encouraging. I guess it would have been nice to know before starting the programme that if I had prioritized my studies and the activities around it more, there is a great potential of being more involved in the Department of Business Humanities and Law already as a bachelor students e.g. through reading clubs etc . What do I want to do after finishing my programme?I would like to go into the area of consulting that challenges the traditional way of doing business and that dare to raise the question of how we can organise corporations differently. I imagine working in the intersection between corporate law and culture, at least for some years."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-philosophy/kirstine,Kirstine,Kirstine (Part 4),"At some point, I can imagine coming back to CBS to do a PhD that is based on what I find empirically relevant as well as my academic interests. If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Make sure that you have adequate time for your studies. Not because the Business Administration and Philosophy programme is especially demanding, but because you really want to understand what you learn on this programme. A lot of the philosophical texts we have read I have always wanted to read on my own, and the economic courses provide a valuable take on why society is as it is. At least, I sometimes feel like I would like to start all over just to get even more out of it."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-innovation-in-health-care/gargi,Gargi,Gargi (Part 1),"Meet Gargi, a student from Innovation in Health Care Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?This programme appealed to me because the global healthcare industry is facing numerous structural, demographic, technological and financial challenges that require innovative solutions. The skills required to enable these innovations are becoming increasingly important, and the IHC programme provides us with the tools and knowledge we need to make a meaningful impact in this ever-growing industry. CBS is an amazing institution that provides its students with unique opportunities, which made it a very appealing university to me! What do I like the best?I love this programme due to its multidisciplinary approach! My classmates and I are from such vast backgrounds (ranging from business to pharmacy to clinical photography), and this provides for such a rich learning environment in lectures and group work. Another thing that I appreciate is the hands-on approach to business in the healthcare sector that the programme provides - it's super useful coming from a non-business background and wanting to learn the ropes of the industry quickly."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-innovation-in-health-care/gargi,Gargi,Gargi (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? There is definitely a significant difference! First, it's a completely different degree (from drug formulation to business development and innovation), but also how the class schedule is structured! CBS allows for approx. two class-free days per week, which makes it possible to work part-time in a student position while studying. Furthermore, the workload and distribution of it is also quite different from the bachelor - in the sense that you are more independent in your studies on the master's level. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?Even though the multidisciplinary background of the students is a key strength, it can also make the initial phase a bit tough. It was challenging to understand the business keywords and parameters but even that was planned for, as we had intensive crash courses in both health and business to ensure that the entire class was on the same level. I also found that the program was structured in a different way than what I was used to from my bachelor. For example, some of the semesters are divided into modules, which was challenging in the start."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-innovation-in-health-care/gargi,Gargi,Gargi (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?Two things that would have been nice to know would be: Firstly, the networking opportunities. The programme offers opportunities for networking with industry experts and alumni. Knowing this in advance could have helped me prepare to make the most of this opportunity. Secondly, the pre-requisite knowledge. In IHC, it’s important to have a clear understanding of basic concepts in healthcare management, innovation and healthcare systems before starting the programme. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?I am extremely interested in business development and consulting (which are two career paths that go hand-in-hand) so I would definitely want to explore that after finishing my programme. With my background in pharmacy, I’m extremely interested in the life-science and pharma industry, and firms like Simon Kucher & Partners and Deloitte are on my radar! Another option that appeals to me is the graduate programme at companies like WSAudiology, Novo Nordisk, EY and so on. These programmes are a fantastic way of getting to know the corporation."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-innovation-in-health-care/gargi,Gargi,Gargi (Part 4),"If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…I would definitely put time management as the highest priority. CBS has many events for students, which are so interesting to attend. Furthermore, there are many exciting organisations at CBS as well, which also require quite a bit of commitment so I would definitely advice myself (and others!) to be good at time management and strategic about it. I would also tell myself to not take it all too seriously and enjoy the programme as it goes along. Deadlines and exams are important, but so is a healthy work-life balance!"

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-innovation-in-health-care/jozsef,Jozsef,Jozsef (Part 1),"Meet Jozsef, a student from Innovation in Health Care Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?Before starting my search for a master’s programme, I had only heard about CBS from a secondary connection. I didn’t know much about the school, but understood its reputation as a quality business school. Given that the IHC program is quite niche, I knew I might have some trouble finding what I was looking for, but luckily I found it at CBS. I researched many other universities but the IHC programme was very unique in the multidisciplinary approach it takes to healthcare, innovation and business administration. What do I like the best?I truly am impressed by the diversity of the programme. We are a mix of international students from both within and outside of Europe. Furthermore, the demographics are split between business and health with classmates from areas such as biological sciences, nursing, pharmacy, business administration and marketing. This brings many different perspectives to the class, which everyone benefits from. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?"
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-innovation-in-health-care/jozsef,Jozsef,Jozsef (Part 2),"Having done my bachelor in the US, it has been an adjustment coming to the Danish education system. Where as in the US grades are often a combinations of exams, projects, assignments and participation, at CBS only the final exam determines your grade. As class attendance and any assignments done during the semester are essentially optional, there is a greater self-responsibility to keep up with course content. Also, there is a much greater emphasis on theory-driven written assignments rather than the practical style of the US. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?Denmark has many different styles of exams which are different from the US, like oral exams, which can have seemingly ambiguous requirements if you are not familiar with them. The most challenging part is that many professors often assume you are familiar with these different styles of exams, so they won't always be so direct about the structure or format of what is expected in an exam. This can be a challenge, so it’s important to ask questions and also consult with peers who have done similar exams before."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-innovation-in-health-care/jozsef,Jozsef,Jozsef (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?I would have like to known that there is a strong focus on academic reading and theory rather than practical case studies. There is still practical work done, but not as much as in the US. Therefore, it’s important that you brush up on your academic writing skills such as describing research design and methodological approaches for collecting data and conducting literature reviews. Also, take note that most classes in the programme run on a quarterly schedule, so you can expect to have fast-paced classes and two rounds of exams each semester. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?After graduation, I am planning to stay in Denmark for my work. There are many organisations here operating in the healthcare and life sciences spaces, making for plenty of employment opportunity. I’m still exploring career paths, but I’m aiming to work for a medical technology company in commercial excellence or market access. Alternatively, I’m considering working in more of a public health capacity within an organisation like the WHO or the European Medicines Agency."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msc-in-business-administration-and-innovation-in-health-care/jozsef,Jozsef,Jozsef (Part 4),"If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Get ready to read a lot and don't be afraid to team up with classmates. Most people in the programme are ambitious and looking to make the best of their education. By finding those who you are compatible to study and work alongside with, you can create a great network and a strong support system. As an international student, give yourself plenty of time to settle here. As someone who is well travelled, I didn't take warnings about how difficult it is to find accommodation too seriously. Come a few weeks early to find a place before classes begin."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msocsc-in-strategic-design-and-entrepreneurship/emilie,Emilie,Emilie (Part 1),"Meet Emilie, a student from Strategic Design and Entrepreneurship Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I chose to study Strategic Design and Entrepreneurship for my master’s, because I found it a unique opportunity to enter the creative industry, working closely with designers and architects from the Royal Danish Academy. Being enrolled in two universities, working with design and architecture from a strategic, entrepreneurial and managerial perspective, is a rare opportunity that I immediately knew I would seek, when the master’s programme was created in 2018. What do I like the best?I mostly enjoy the collaborative aspect of the programme, working closely together with both architects, designers and business students with a variety of backgrounds. The class is very international, why many different perspectives are added in the collaborative process, which just makes the process more exciting and inspiring. In addition, I also enjoy the courses and content given, that facilitate the journey of becoming a strategic designer really well, balancing the business-oriented content with the artistic. How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme?"
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msocsc-in-strategic-design-and-entrepreneurship/emilie,Emilie,Emilie (Part 2),"I previously studied a BA in Design Culture and Economics, which was also a mix between business courses and design-theoretic courses, so this combination isn't new to me. The biggest difference is working in teams for almost every course and project, which really makes us learn how to collaborate with many different skills, experiences, knowledge and perspectives. Most of the projects are based on client challenges, meaning there are high ambitions, speed and engagement, which is a great way to practise and work in your master’s. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?Not being able to really try out new ways of learning from each other, for example becoming better in doing graphics, building prototypes etc. Since time is limited, we easily do what we're good at, so the business students tend to write, and the design and architecture students tend to create. Now that we're in the same programme, we'd all love to really learn from each other and develop our skills a bit more across disciplines. On the other hand, it's also a journey of really understanding what skills you have and use them in practice."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msocsc-in-strategic-design-and-entrepreneurship/emilie,Emilie,Emilie (Part 3),"What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?I'd like to have known that the classes are spread all over the week, because of the Royal Academy’s way of working. There is therefore very little time for other activities throughout the week, since there're classes almost every day. This master’s really requires that you're invested time wise if you want to get the most out of it. Thus, there has been a discussion about clustering the classes for the upcoming years, so people can schedule ahead, coordinating with work etc. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?I want to work with strategic consulting in the creative industry. I want to use my experience in working with both design thinking, actor-network theory etc., together with more traditional consultant tools, to guide companies into the green transition on a holistic level. Because of my BA background and now also this master’s, I see myself as the intermediate link that can create sustainable business development in a variety of ways, but most importantly with an empathic, innovative, conscious and holistic mindset."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msocsc-in-strategic-design-and-entrepreneurship/emilie,Emilie,Emilie (Part 4),"If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…That the high expectations you have for this master’s programme will actually be fulfilled and even surpass the dreams and hopes. You'll really be a part of a great adventure that only a few can get. I'm so grateful for the opportunity to work with these amazing people, both at CBS and at the Royal Academy. We're in the centre of knowledge, experiments, innovation and development, and it's extremely inspiring and giving."

https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msocsc-in-strategic-design-and-entrepreneurship/pedro,Pedro,Pedro (Part 1),"Meet Pedro, a student from Strategic Design and Entrepreneurship Why did I choose my programme (and CBS)?I wanted to apply to a different programme at CBS, yet I could not do it, as I lacked ECTS. However, as I have always been drawn to graphic and editorial design, I was also curious to apply to the Royal Danish Academy. After reading the programme description and goals thoroughly, I found this to be the right fit to merge my communication background with the design field - that was my main motivation for applying, considering back then, I wanted to work as a Head of Communicactions in a design or architecture studio. What do I like the best?How interdisciplinary the programme is, but by far, the most thrilling part of the programme is the collaboration between CBS and Academy students. The first year is spent in cross-collaborative real projects - for instance, I worked in real cases for the Copenhagen Light Festival and Rigshospitalet (one of the leading hospitals in Denmark). Also, one of my favourite parts of the programme is sitting at the Academy's studio and watching my artsy classmates work on design or architecture projects and what that involves (i.e. software, ceramics...)."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msocsc-in-strategic-design-and-entrepreneurship/pedro,Pedro,Pedro (Part 2),"How do I experience the difference in academic level between my bachelor and master programme? The master’s has been more independent oriented, which I believe is more of a cultural difference between studying in Portugal when compared to Denmark. Academically, I don’t feel a big difference because when I was a bachelor student in the social sciences field, I had to write a lot of reports. Nevertheless, I would say that a big difference was how much more 'freeing' I find the studies to be here in Denmark. The relation with the professors at CBS is quite 'one-to-one', of course still aware of the professional and academic respect of both parts. What are the biggest challenges in my programme?Coordinating between two institutions. However, it’s only a matter of time before you get the hang of it. At the beginning, getting used to all of CBS' software, internal platforms and more was a tad confusing – more, when multiplied by two, considering the Academy had similar platforms. Furthermore, working with art students is of great value, and at the same time, one of the challenges in the programme."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msocsc-in-strategic-design-and-entrepreneurship/pedro,Pedro,Pedro (Part 3),"It is a 'growth pain', as one of the goals of this master’s is to learn how creative professionals think, and for these to know ""how business thinks"". What would I have liked to have known before starting my programme?That contrasted to the first year, the second year is quite lonely. We move from an intense, collaborative and stimulating first year, where there is an almost 'creative ecstasy', to a quite independent second year. At first, it was pretty challenging to get used to it, but then you get easily acquainted to it. What helped was to think of this programme as two master’s programmes: the first year you learn about strategic design and entrepreneurship with fellow art students. The second year you specialise in whatever area you are fond of. What do I want to do after finishing my programme?Still pretty blurry, but I would like to work with design for the public sector. I am very interested in the role of public sector innovation labs, but more, how design-led practices can be included in governance in a systematic way instead of being a ""one trick pony""."
https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/graduate/msocsc-in-strategic-design-and-entrepreneurship/pedro,Pedro,Pedro (Part 4),"Other student usually work as strategic design consultants in-house, or they do it as consultants (something I have definitely not excluded as well). If I could give myself a piece of advice, before starting it would be…Align expectations. CBS and the Academy have a lot to offer. Problem is, there is only so much time available when you have to study, work, have a social life, cook and so on... I would have loved to be part of a CBS club, as I would have liked to have attended more conferences. Also, choose electives based on what you are curious about, even if just a hint. I chose some of my electives based on what I thought my thesis topic would be - plot twist, it did not happen. My favourite elective was in policy making, something I had never thought of."
