Areas to be covered include, but are not limited to, an individual’s choice of consumption and portfolio selection, and comprehensive pricing models. These models will be further developed into dynamic multi-period models, which are used in the most quantitative financial institutions.The ability to create mathematical pricing models will be essential as you progress into more advanced topics, for example, derivatives and credit risk. You will also learn how to deal with and/or prevent principal-agent problems, such as conflicts in owner-manager relations and the use of appropriate incentive schemes. Through game theory, advanced multi-period and multiple-agent models, you will develop a quantitative approach to solving problems of corporate policy. For instance, when writing contracts, you will deal with asymmetric information, incentive schemes and/or risk sharing in order to ascertain how these agency issues relate to particular governance systems in a corporation.

Investors form portfolios of different securities, and you will learn analytical tools for selecting portfolios optimally. The risk-return trade-off is essential to investments, and modern finance focuses on identifying relevant risk measures and the risk premia investors can obtain by exposing themselves to the various sources of risk. You will see theoretical models of the risk-return trade-off, but also empirical studies of the observed risk-return relation. Financial industry and marketsYou will obtain a solid knowledge of the different players in financial markets. Companies use financial markets for raising capital, for short-term liquidity and risk management, and as a source of information for internal decisions related to capital budgeting and corporate governance. Households interact with financial markets when saving and investing for retirement or other purposes and when taking mortgages and other loans.'),\n",

You will learn about the financial decisions of companies, households, and financial institutions and the influence these decisions have on financial markets. Analytical and communicative skillsThe understanding and applications of both theoretical models and empirical methods in finance require specialized skills in mathematics, statistics, and IT. By nature, financial models build on tools and concepts from probability theory and statistics in order to represent the uncertainty which is so crucial for financial decisions.

What to consider Finance is a quantitative disciplineCompared to most other areas in business and social sciences, finance is a quantitative discipline drawing upon economics, mathematics, statistics, and IT. This is necessarily so. Simply stated, the price of a financial security depends on its future cash flow, and this cash flow is typically unknown. Therefore, potential investors need to consider both the timing and the riskiness of the future cash flows. To quantify the risks, we need probabilities. We need economic arguments to choose the appropriate discount rates in order to determine the present value. To learn from historical data and test our models, we need statistics, and to work on large data sets we need IT. More generally, companies and households making financing and investment decisions have to determine and maximize the values of different choices.\"),\n",

Study environment Study Environment/LifeThe PBD-student group is previously drawn from diverse origins; 20% international and 80% Danish students, but with a growing number of international students. A majority comes from CBS bachelor programmes of which a fair amount comes from the bachelor programmes: HA(psyk.) and BSc SEM. The gender distribution is around 75% women /25% men. Uncharacteristically for the field, 80% of the teachers are men. Student life at CBSStudying at CBS is much more than just preparing for and going to classes.

Teaching and exams Teaching While the PBD-programme competences are based on evidence- and theory based analyses, these skills are built using a diverse range of cases of which many are “live-cases”. The PBD-projects are the most extensive of these: you and your group will work in 2,5 month on a real-life people and development change project supported by a supervisor. But all teaching at the PBD-programme is extensively anchored and contextualised by organisational cases. The course is organised in four 15 ECTS blocks, which lets you immerse yourself in the same topic and exercise your skills to a deeper level of understanding.

The aim is to provide you with understanding of how some tools perform in the big picture.

IT at the core of businessThe significance of digital and information technologies in business is greater than ever. Almost every activity and decision in a company depends on IT, and therefore IT considerations are key concerns in a range of business functions, including human resources, finance, manufacturing and security. Companies and organisations rely on IT when pursuing their digital business aspirations, communicating with employees, suppliers and customers, and IT is used to observe changes in markets, to keep up with supply and demand, and to reduce cost and risk by collecting and analysing data and information. In a world permeated by digital technologies, having an IT organisation that effectively contributes to organisations ambitions is not a choice, but is a necessity. IT as a toolIn this programme you learn how to use digital and information technologies to add value to companies and organisations.

    "The RAG setup worked pretty well. The system was able to find the right pieces of information most of the time, and the answers it generated were accurate and matched what we expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "20% of the answers added extra info that wasn’t actually in the source document suggesting that the model hallucinated a bit. That is however a general problem for LLMs so we took the model from the exercise as a benchmark and our model performed good enough to be happy with the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the hyperparameters:\n",
    "- We chose Fixed-sized chunking for its simplicity and relevance to the context, since the data we analyzed was a political speech.\n",
    "- Semantic chunking could improve the results, but since our model was generalizing well enough, we decided not to over-complicate things.\n",
    "- The chunk size had to be reduced from 1000 to 500, because the WatsonX embedding model has a token limit of 512 tokens.\n",
    "- More generally, parameters like retriever, top-k size, or prompt structure could improve our model, but in this context, it would rather complicate things, which was not necessary.\n",
    "- Using a simple prompt format worked fine, but more controlled prompting might reduce hallucination even more."
